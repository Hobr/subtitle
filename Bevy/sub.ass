Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.12,0:00:05.00,英文,,0,0,0,,Morning everyone! I'm Isaac, and I'm a software developer who can never decide what to focus on.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:06.56,英文,,0,0,0,,I'd like to introduce you to Bevy,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.56,0:00:10.48,英文,,0,0,0,,a game engine written in Rust that I've really come to enjoy working with.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.48,0:00:14.88,英文,,0,0,0,,If you haven't heard of Rust and want to learn, I highly recommend looking at No Boilerplate's
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.88,0:00:19.12,英文,,0,0,0,,videos on this subject (who was also my inspiration on making videos in the first place).
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.12,0:00:21.24,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy is a lovely game engine to work in,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.24,0:00:25.08,英文,,0,0,0,,and that comes without any catches when it comes to performance or ability.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.08,0:00:27.44,英文,,0,0,0,,There's no proprietary framework you must work within and there's
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.44,0:00:29.96,英文,,0,0,0,,no strange domain-specific language you need to learn to get started.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.72,0:00:34.04,英文,,0,0,0,,Simple structs and functions do all the work for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.04,0:00:38.24,英文,,0,0,0,,Additionally, Bevy is completely open source and funded by the community, which means you
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.24,0:00:42.08,英文,,0,0,0,,don't need to fret about how your game will pay for it or if it'll go under any time soon.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.08,0:00:45.96,英文,,0,0,0,,If you're dreaming of going big, Bevy will be there for you every step of the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.96,0:00:49.40,英文,,0,0,0,,To get started, we'll go ahead and make a new Rust project using Cargo,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.40,0:00:51.24,英文,,0,0,0,,Rust's amazing package manager.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.24,0:00:55.52,英文,,0,0,0,,If you've never used Cargo, don't be afraid, as it's pretty much best in class.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.52,0:00:59.40,英文,,0,0,0,,Run this command in the terminal in whatever folder you want the project to live in,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.40,0:01:01.88,英文,,0,0,0,,then open up the folder in your favorite text editor.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.88,0:01:03.20,英文,,0,0,0,,For folks new to programming,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.20,0:01:07.24,英文,,0,0,0,,I recommend Visual Studio Code with the rust-analyzer extension installed.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.24,0:01:10.12,英文,,0,0,0,,Next, we'll add these changes to your Cargo.toml.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.12,0:01:15.04,英文,,0,0,0,,This imports Bevy and enables dynamic linking, which makes your compiles much faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.04,0:01:18.60,英文,,0,0,0,,It also applies a small amount of optimization to your code and a large
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.60,0:01:23.60,英文,,0,0,0,,amount of optimization to your dependencies, making your dev build much more performant.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.60,0:01:25.60,英文,,0,0,0,,Finally, let's rewrite our main.rs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.60,0:01:30.48,英文,,0,0,0,,All this does is spin up a new Bevy instance, add all the default plugins
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.48,0:01:35.24,英文,,0,0,0,,to it (which do things like window management so you don't have to do it yourself), and run it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.24,0:01:36.64,英文,,0,0,0,,It is time to compile!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.64,0:01:38.56,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll note that this will take a while, so while
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.56,0:01:42.44,英文,,0,0,0,,this first compilation run is happening go ahead and grab a cup of coffee or tea.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.44,0:01:45.64,英文,,0,0,0,,Thankfully, Cargo is amazing and once we've compiled our dependencies,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.64,0:01:49.96,英文,,0,0,0,,the only thing we'll need to recompile going forward is our code, not anyone else's.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.96,0:01:53.04,英文,,0,0,0,,If you run into any problems, make sure you read the error text.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.04,0:01:57.44,英文,,0,0,0,,Odds are, you're just missing a system package or two, especially if you're on Linux.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.44,0:01:59.68,英文,,0,0,0,,Success! Our game isn't doing anything yet,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.68,0:02:02.80,英文,,0,0,0,,but we have a running app, and that means we can do whatever we want.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.80,0:02:04.96,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's talk about how Bevy actually works.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.96,0:02:07.44,英文,,0,0,0,,Unlike other engines that use object-oriented designs
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.44,0:02:13.28,英文,,0,0,0,,to facilitate game behavior, Bevy makes use of an entity-component-system model, or ECS.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.28,0:02:17.64,英文,,0,0,0,,This is a super fast way of storing the kind of unstructured data that lives in a game.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.64,0:02:19.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's go over what those terms mean.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.76,0:02:24.84,英文,,0,0,0,,Components are basic pieces of data with no behavior (that part's important!).
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.84,0:02:28.16,英文,,0,0,0,,This can be things like an Inventory or Health component.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.16,0:02:32.32,英文,,0,0,0,,Components can be made up of any number of fields, but they all come as a single package.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.32,0:02:34.80,英文,,0,0,0,,You can't have half a component.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.80,0:02:38.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Entities are collections of components which represent a game object.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.76,0:02:41.80,英文,,0,0,0,,This can be any number of things in your game, including the player,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.80,0:02:46.60,英文,,0,0,0,,enemies, the camera, terrain, a chest, particle systems, etc.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.60,0:02:52.24,英文,,0,0,0,,The only thing that determines what kind of thing an entity is is what components it contains.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.24,0:02:56.80,英文,,0,0,0,,Put another way, you can think of entities and components as a big table,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.80,0:02:59.84,英文,,0,0,0,,with entities as rows and components as columns.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.76,0:03:03.08,英文,,0,0,0,,Each entity must have at least one component,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.08,0:03:07.72,英文,,0,0,0,,but there's no limit to the number or the combination of components an entity can have.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.72,0:03:12.68,英文,,0,0,0,,Systems are stateless functions that operate on entities and components.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.68,0:03:16.80,英文,,0,0,0,,Systems don't have any state - instead, Bevy keeps track of the entities and
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.80,0:03:22.40,英文,,0,0,0,,components separately and uses queries and commands to allow systems to work with them.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.40,0:03:26.00,英文,,0,0,0,,By completely separating state from behavior, Bevy allows you
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.00,0:03:31.40,英文,,0,0,0,,to create complex game systems that are massively reusable without much thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.40,0:03:35.72,英文,,0,0,0,,It gets out of your way and lets you write the code that really matters.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.72,0:03:38.96,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, with that explained, let's make our first system.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.96,0:03:42.12,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy's systems are triggered by various schedules.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.12,0:03:45.32,英文,,0,0,0,,The two you'll probably use for now are "Startup" and "Update",
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.32,0:03:49.08,英文,,0,0,0,,but there are others with specific use cases (and you can even make your own!).
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.08,0:03:52.96,英文,,0,0,0,,Here, we're registering our "setup" system to make it run on startup.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.96,0:03:55.00,英文,,0,0,0,,The system itself isn't doing much yet,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.00,0:03:59.28,英文,,0,0,0,,just spawning the in-game camera, but we'll change that now.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.28,0:04:02.60,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's add a small circle to the center of the screen.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.60,0:04:05.44,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll notice we had to add a couple new parameters to our system;
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.44,0:04:09.16,英文,,0,0,0,,these just allow us to get handles to new meshes and materials.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.16,0:04:12.84,英文,,0,0,0,,Additionally, we added a new component - we'll get back to that in a minute.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.84,0:04:16.20,英文,,0,0,0,,For now, compile your game and see it run!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.20,0:04:21.00,英文,,0,0,0,,Success! But Isaac, you say, this isn't a game yet! We're just rendering a circle.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.00,0:04:23.56,英文,,0,0,0,,That's where you're wrong. Are you ready for this?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.56,0:04:25.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's right. Input handling.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.76,0:04:28.36,英文,,0,0,0,,We're going to make our circle move.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.36,0:04:30.00,英文,,0,0,0,,Not to make it too complicated though.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.00,0:04:34.92,英文,,0,0,0,,For our example, we're just going to be making our circle respond to basic WASD keypresses.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.92,0:04:37.92,英文,,0,0,0,,We'll be taking advantage of Bevy's built-in input hooks,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.92,0:04:40.92,英文,,0,0,0,,but other libraries exist that abstract this away a bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.92,0:04:43.84,英文,,0,0,0,,To start out with, let's make another new system.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.84,0:04:47.32,英文,,0,0,0,,This system has a query that returns Transform components,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.32,0:04:49.84,英文,,0,0,0,,which include position and rotation data.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.84,0:04:54.96,英文,,0,0,0,,Specifically, we only want Transform components from entities that also have a Player component.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.96,0:04:56.40,英文,,0,0,0,,Remember when we made that?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.40,0:04:58.96,英文,,0,0,0,,It's nothing special, and doesn't even store data.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.96,0:05:02.52,英文,,0,0,0,,We can use empty components like this as "marker" components,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.52,0:05:07.44,英文,,0,0,0,,which make it easier to select specific kinds of entities - like our Player entity here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.44,0:05:11.08,英文,,0,0,0,,Next, we're going to loop through all of the entities that this query gives us.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.08,0:05:13.72,英文,,0,0,0,,Obviously this will just be one player in this instance,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.72,0:05:17.80,英文,,0,0,0,,but you can use this with things that may have many entities or even none!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.80,0:05:21.12,英文,,0,0,0,,We need to know what buttons are being pressed in order to respond to them,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.12,0:05:23.12,英文,,0,0,0,,so we'll go ahead and add another parameter.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.12,0:05:28.32,英文,,0,0,0,,This isn't a query, but instead a reference to the ButtonInput resource within Bevy.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.32,0:05:31.24,英文,,0,0,0,,We'll also add a "direction" vector at the start of our loop,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.24,0:05:35.08,英文,,0,0,0,,as well as the code to use that vector to update where our player is.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.08,0:05:40.24,英文,,0,0,0,,Notice we've made a "Move Speed" constant up above our function; you don't have to do this,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.24,0:05:44.56,英文,,0,0,0,,but I personally prefer to avoid nameless magic numbers in my code.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.56,0:05:47.28,英文,,0,0,0,,Finally, it's time to write the code that determines where our
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.28,0:05:52.28,英文,,0,0,0,,player is moving towards! This part is relatively straightforward. Just check if a key is pressed,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.28,0:05:56.40,英文,,0,0,0,,and if it is, nudge the direction in the appropriate direction.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.40,0:06:00.88,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll note that we check both key directions even if we've already detected one.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.88,0:06:05.84,英文,,0,0,0,,This means that if you were to hold down both A and D, your player wouldn't move horizontally,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.84,0:06:08.44,英文,,0,0,0,,rather than one direction overriding the other.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.44,0:06:12.84,英文,,0,0,0,,This may or may not be how you want your player to move, but it's easily changeable.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.84,0:06:17.68,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's add our new system to our game, this time running under the "Update" system.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.68,0:06:20.56,英文,,0,0,0,,The Update system will run on every frame.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.56,0:06:23.16,英文,,0,0,0,,Let us witness the fruits of our labor!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.16,0:06:28.00,英文,,0,0,0,,Success! We're now able to move our circle around on the screen (and even off it!).
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.00,0:06:31.36,英文,,0,0,0,,Obviously there's more to game design than knowing how to move a circle around, but
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.36,0:06:35.68,英文,,0,0,0,,sometimes the technical side is the hardest part to break into, so hopefully this helped you out.
