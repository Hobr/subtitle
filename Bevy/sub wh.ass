Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.08,0:00:04.56,英文,,0,0,0,,Morning everyone! I'm Isaac, and I'm a software developer who can never decide what to focus on.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.56,0:00:08.64,英文,,0,0,0,,Today I'd like to introduce you to Bevy, a game engine written in Rust that I've really come to enjoy working with.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.64,0:00:13.76,英文,,0,0,0,,If you haven't heard of Rust and you want to learn,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.76,0:00:17.84,英文,,0,0,0,,I highly recommend looking at No Boilerplate's videos on the subject,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.84,0:00:22.72,英文,,0,0,0,,who was also my inspiration on making videos in the first place. Bevy is a lovely game engine to work in,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.72,0:00:27.04,英文,,0,0,0,,and that comes without any catches when it comes to performance or ability. There's no proprietary framework you must work within,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.04,0:00:30.08,英文,,0,0,0,,and there's no strange domain-specific language you must learn to get started.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.08,0:00:33.20,英文,,0,0,0,,Simple functions and structs do all the work for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.20,0:00:37.68,英文,,0,0,0,,Additionally, Bevy is completely open source and funded by the community,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.68,0:00:40.96,英文,,0,0,0,,which means you don't need to fret about how your game will pay for it or if it'll go under anytime soon.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.96,0:00:45.84,英文,,0,0,0,,If you're dreaming of going big, Bevy will be there for you every step of the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.84,0:00:50.64,英文,,0,0,0,,To get started, we'll go ahead and make a new Rust project using Cargo, Rust's amazing package manager.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.64,0:00:54.80,英文,,0,0,0,,If you've never used Cargo, don't be afraid, as it's pretty much best in class.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.80,0:00:56.96,英文,,0,0,0,,Run this command in the terminal,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.96,0:01:00.64,英文,,0,0,0,,and whatever folder you want the project to live in, then open up the folder in your favorite text editor.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.64,0:01:04.24,英文,,0,0,0,,For folks new to programming,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.24,0:01:10.00,英文,,0,0,0,,I recommend Visual Studio Code with the rust-analyzer extension installed. Next, we'll add these changes to your cargo.toml.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.00,0:01:15.36,英文,,0,0,0,,This imports Bevy and enables dynamic linking, which makes your compiles much faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.36,0:01:19.68,英文,,0,0,0,,It also applies a small amount of optimization to your code and a large amount of optimization to your dependencies,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.68,0:01:25.84,英文,,0,0,0,,making your dev builds much more performant. Finally, let's rewrite our main.rs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.48,0:01:31.68,英文,,0,0,0,,All this does is spin up a new Bevy instance, add all the default plugins to it, which do things like
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.68,0:01:36.56,英文,,0,0,0,,window management so you don't have to do it yourself, and run it. It is time to compile.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.56,0:01:40.00,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll note that this will take a while, so while this first compilation run is happening,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.00,0:01:44.24,英文,,0,0,0,,go ahead and grab a cup of coffee or tea. Thankfully, Cargo is amazing, and once we've compiled our dependencies,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.24,0:01:48.48,英文,,0,0,0,,the only thing we need to recompile going forward is our code, not anyone else's.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.48,0:01:52.96,英文,,0,0,0,,If you run into any problems, make sure you read the error text.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.96,0:01:56.32,英文,,0,0,0,,Odds are, you're just missing a system package or two, especially if you're online.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.32,0:02:00.72,英文,,0,0,0,,Success! Our game isn't doing anything yet,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.72,0:02:04.88,英文,,0,0,0,,but we have a running app, and that means we can do whatever we want. Let's talk about how Bevy actually works.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.88,0:02:08.96,英文,,0,0,0,,Unlike other engines that use object-oriented designs to facilitate game behavior,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.96,0:02:14.80,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy makes use of an Entity Component System Model, or ECS.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.80,0:02:18.88,英文,,0,0,0,,This is a super-fast way of storing the kind of unstructured data that lives in a game. Let's go over what those terms mean.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.88,0:02:25.84,英文,,0,0,0,,Components are basic pieces of data with no behavior. This can be things like an inventory or a health component.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.84,0:02:30.48,英文,,0,0,0,,Components can be made up of any number of fields,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.48,0:02:33.76,英文,,0,0,0,,but they all come as a single package, you can't have half a component.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.76,0:02:39.52,英文,,0,0,0,,Entities are collections of components which represent a game object. This can be any number of things in your game,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.52,0:02:44.64,英文,,0,0,0,,including the player, enemies, the camera, terrain, a chest, particle systems, etc.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.64,0:02:49.60,英文,,0,0,0,,The only thing that determines what kind of thing an entity is, is what components it contains.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.60,0:02:55.68,英文,,0,0,0,,Put another way, you can think of entities and components as a big table, with entities as rows and components as columns.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.40,0:03:06.88,英文,,0,0,0,,Each entity must have at least one component, but there's no limit to the number or the combination of components an entity can have.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.88,0:03:13.60,英文,,0,0,0,,Systems are stateless functions that operate on entities and components. Systems don't have any state. Instead,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.60,0:03:19.12,英文,,0,0,0,, Bevy keeps track of the entities and components separately and uses queries and
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.12,0:03:25.52,英文,,0,0,0,,commands to allow systems to work with them. By completely separating state from behavior,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.52,0:03:31.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy allows you to create complex game systems that are massively reusable without much thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.76,0:03:37.44,英文,,0,0,0,,It gets out of your way and lets you write the code that really matters. Now with that explained, let's make our first system.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.44,0:03:43.36,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy's systems are triggered by various schedules.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.36,0:03:48.32,英文,,0,0,0,,The two that you'll probably use for now are startup and update, but there are others with specific use cases, and you can even make your own.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.32,0:03:55.36,英文,,0,0,0,,Here we're registering our setup system to make it run on startup. The system itself isn't doing much yet,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.36,0:04:01.44,英文,,0,0,0,,just spawning in the in-game camera, but we'll change that now. Let's add a small circle to the center of our screen.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.44,0:04:05.76,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll notice that we had to add a couple new parameters to our system.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.76,0:04:11.36,英文,,0,0,0,,These just allow us to get handles to new meshes and materials. Additionally, we added a new component. We'll get back to that in a minute.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.36,0:04:18.56,英文,,0,0,0,,For now, compile your game and see it run. Success!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.56,0:04:25.20,英文,,0,0,0,,But Isaac, you say, this isn't a game yet, we're just rendering a circle. That's where you're wrong. Are you ready for this? Yeah, that's right. Input handling.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.20,0:04:30.64,英文,,0,0,0,,We're going to make our circle move. Not to make it too complicated, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.64,0:04:36.08,英文,,0,0,0,,For our example, we're just going to be making our circle respond to basic WASD key presses.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.08,0:04:40.88,英文,,0,0,0,,We'll be taking advantage of Bevy's built-in input hooks, but other libraries do exist that extract this away a bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.88,0:04:45.92,英文,,0,0,0,,To start out with, let's make another new system. This system has a query that returns transform components,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.92,0:04:50.56,英文,,0,0,0,,which include position and rotation data.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.56,0:04:55.04,英文,,0,0,0,,Specifically, we only want transform components from entities that also have a player component.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.04,0:04:59.68,英文,,0,0,0,,Remember, when we made that? It's nothing special, and doesn't even store data.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.68,0:05:05.20,英文,,0,0,0,,We can use empty components like this as marker components, which make it easier to select specific kinds of entities, like our player entity here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.20,0:05:10.32,英文,,0,0,0,,Next, we're going to loop through all the entities that this query gives us.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.32,0:05:14.80,英文,,0,0,0,,Obviously, this will just be one player in this instance, but you can use this with things that may have many entities, or even none.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.80,0:05:20.00,英文,,0,0,0,,We need to know what buttons are being pressed in order to respond to them,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.00,0:05:24.88,英文,,0,0,0,,so we'll go ahead and add another parameter.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.88,0:05:30.16,英文,,0,0,0,,This isn't a query, but instead gets a reference to the button input resource within Bevy. We'll also add a direction vector at the start of our loop,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.16,0:05:34.88,英文,,0,0,0,,as well as the code to use that vector to update where our player is.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.88,0:05:40.08,英文,,0,0,0,,Notice that we've made a "moveSpeed" constant up above our function. You don't have to do this,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.08,0:05:45.68,英文,,0,0,0,,but I personally prefer to avoid nameless magic numbers in my code.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.68,0:05:49.60,英文,,0,0,0,,Finally, it's time to write the code that determines where our player is moving towards. This part is relatively straightforward.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.60,0:05:54.72,英文,,0,0,0,,Just check if a key is pressed, and if it is, nudge the direction in the appropriate direction.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.72,0:06:00.00,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll note that we check both key directions, even if we've already detected one.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.00,0:06:05.60,英文,,0,0,0,,This means that if you were to hold down both A and D,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.60,0:06:10.32,英文,,0,0,0,,your player wouldn't move horizontally, rather than one direction overriding the other. This may or may not be how you want your player
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.32,0:06:14.72,英文,,0,0,0,,to move, but it's easily changeable.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.72,0:06:19.84,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's add our new system to our game, this time running under the "update" system. The update system will run on every frame.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.84,0:06:24.56,英文,,0,0,0,,Let us witness the fruits of our labor. Success!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.56,0:06:29.20,英文,,0,0,0,,We are now able to move our circle around on the screen, and even off it!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.20,0:06:32.64,英文,,0,0,0,,Obviously there's more to game design than knowing how to move a circle around, but sometimes the technical side is the hardest
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.64,0:06:37.12,英文,,0,0,0,,part to break into, so hopefully this helped you out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.12,0:06:40.88,英文,,0,0,0,,Here are some really good resources that I took advantage of when I was first getting started in Bevy.
