Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.12,0:00:00.83,英文,,0,0,0,,Morning everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.04,0:00:04.22,英文,,0,0,0,,I'm Isaac, and I'm a software developer who can never decide what to focus on.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.56,0:00:06.35,英文,,0,0,0,,Today I'd like to introduce you to Bevy,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.56,0:00:09.98,英文,,0,0,0,,a game engine written in Rust that I've really come to enjoy working with.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.48,0:00:12.74,英文,,0,0,0,,If you haven't heard of Rust and you want to learn,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.93,0:00:15.92,英文,,0,0,0,,I highly recommend looking at No Boilerplate's videos on this subject
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.92,0:00:18.62,英文,,0,0,0,,who was also my inspiration on making videos in the first place.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.12,0:00:21.24,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy is a lovely game engine to work in,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.24,0:00:24.82,英文,,0,0,0,,and that comes without any catches when it comes to performance or ability.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.14,0:00:27.20,英文,,0,0,0,,There's no proprietary framework you must work within
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.20,0:00:30.22,英文,,0,0,0,,and there's no strange domain-specific language you must learn to get started.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.72,0:00:33.36,英文,,0,0,0,,Simple functions and structs do all the work for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.04,0:00:37.89,英文,,0,0,0,,Additionally, Bevy is completely open source and funded by the community,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.89,0:00:41.76,英文,,0,0,0,,which means you don't need to fret about how your game will pay for it or if it'll go under anytime soon.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.17,0:00:45.58,英文,,0,0,0,,If you're dreaming of going big, Bevy will be there for you every step of the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.96,0:00:50.99,英文,,0,0,0,,To get started, we'll go ahead and make a new Rust project using Cargo, Rust's amazing package manager.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.24,0:00:55.06,英文,,0,0,0,,If you've never used Cargo, don't be afraid, as it's pretty much best in class.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.54,0:00:59.18,英文,,0,0,0,,Run this command in the terminal in whatever folder you want the project to live in,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.42,0:01:01.88,英文,,0,0,0,,then open up the folder in your favorite text editor.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.02,0:01:03.20,英文,,0,0,0,,For folks new to programming,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.20,0:01:06.50,英文,,0,0,0,,I recommend Visual Studio Code with the rust-analyzer extension installed.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.10,0:01:09.81,英文,,0,0,0,,Next, we'll add these changes to your Cargo.toml.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.12,0:01:14.74,英文,,0,0,0,,This imports Bevy and enables dynamic linking, which makes your compiles much faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.04,0:01:17.98,英文,,0,0,0,,It also applies a small amount of optimization to your code
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.16,0:01:20.58,英文,,0,0,0,,and a large amount of optimization to your dependencies,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.74,0:01:22.88,英文,,0,0,0,,making your dev builds much more performant.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.60,0:01:26.26,英文,,0,0,0,,Finally, let's rewrite our main.rs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.60,0:01:28.99,英文,,0,0,0,,All this does is spin up a new Bevy instance,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.12,0:01:33.55,英文,,0,0,0,,add all the default plugins to it which do things like window management so you don't have to do it yourself.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.97,0:01:36.64,英文,,0,0,0,,and run it. It is time to compile.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.64,0:01:38.05,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll note that this will take a while,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.05,0:01:42.44,英文,,0,0,0,,so while this first compilation run is happening, go ahead and grab a cup of coffee or tea.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.44,0:01:45.64,英文,,0,0,0,,Thankfully, Cargo is amazing and once we've compiled our dependencies,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.64,0:01:49.57,英文,,0,0,0,,the only thing we need to recompile going forward is our code, not anyone else's.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.13,0:01:52.92,英文,,0,0,0,,If you run into any problems, make sure you read the error text.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.04,0:01:56.99,英文,,0,0,0,,Odds are, you're just missing a system package or two, especially if you're on Linux.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.38,0:01:59.68,英文,,0,0,0,,Success. Our game isn't doing anything yet,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.68,0:02:02.40,英文,,0,0,0,,but we have a running app, and that means we can do whatever we want.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.80,0:02:04.70,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's talk about how Bevy actually works.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.96,0:02:09.00,英文,,0,0,0,,Unlike other engines that use object-oriented designs to facilitate game behavior,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.08,0:02:13.01,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy makes use of an Entity Component System Model, or ECS.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.28,0:02:17.14,英文,,0,0,0,,This is a super-fast way of storing the kind of unstructured data that lives in a game.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.64,0:02:18.98,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's go over what those terms mean.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.76,0:02:23.98,英文,,0,0,0,,Components are basic pieces of data with no behavior, that part's important.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.84,0:02:27.57,英文,,0,0,0,,This can be things like an inventory or a health component.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.16,0:02:30.53,英文,,0,0,0,,Components can be made up of any number of fields,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.63,0:02:33.86,英文,,0,0,0,,but they all come as a single package, you can't have half a component.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.75,0:02:38.43,英文,,0,0,0,,Entities are collections of components which represent a game object.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.76,0:02:40.50,英文,,0,0,0,,This can be any number of things in your game,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.50,0:02:46.26,英文,,0,0,0,,including the player, enemies, the camera, terrain, a chest, particle systems, etc.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.60,0:02:51.41,英文,,0,0,0,,The only thing that determines what kind of thing an entity is is what components it contains.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.24,0:02:53.04,英文,,0,0,0,,Put another way,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.13,0:03:00.22,英文,,0,0,0,,you can think of entities and components as a big table with entities as rows and components as columns.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.67,0:03:03.08,英文,,0,0,0,,Each entity must have at least one component,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.08,0:03:07.01,英文,,0,0,0,,but there's no limit to the number or the combination of components an entity can have.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.63,0:03:12.19,英文,,0,0,0,,Systems are stateless functions that operate on entities and components.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.58,0:03:15.08,英文,,0,0,0,,Systems don't have any state. Instead,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.21,0:03:17.92,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy keeps track of the entities and components separately
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.04,0:03:21.63,英文,,0,0,0,,and uses queries and commands to allow systems to work with them.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.40,0:03:25.21,英文,,0,0,0,,By completely separating state from behavior,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.21,0:03:30.85,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy allows you to create complex game systems that are massively reusable without much thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.40,0:03:35.30,英文,,0,0,0,,It gets out of your way and lets you write the code that really matters.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.63,0:03:38.40,英文,,0,0,0,,Now with that explained, let's make our first system.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.88,0:03:41.98,英文,,0,0,0,,Bevy's systems are triggered by various schedules.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.12,0:03:45.32,英文,,0,0,0,,The two that you'll probably use for now are startup and update,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.32,0:03:48.53,英文,,0,0,0,,but there are others with specific use cases, and you can even make your own.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.08,0:03:52.35,英文,,0,0,0,,Here we're registering our setup system to make it run on startup.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.96,0:03:55.00,英文,,0,0,0,,The system itself isn't doing much yet,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.00,0:03:58.48,英文,,0,0,0,,just spawning in the in-game camera, but we'll change that now.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.28,0:04:02.05,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's add a small circle to the center of our screen.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.63,0:04:05.18,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll notice we had to add a couple new parameters to our system,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.44,0:04:08.69,英文,,0,0,0,,these just allow us to get handles to new meshes and materials.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.16,0:04:12.35,英文,,0,0,0,,Additionally, we added a new component. We'll get back to that in a minute.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.88,0:04:15.06,英文,,0,0,0,,For now, compile your game and see it run.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.13,0:04:16.94,英文,,0,0,0,,Success.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.20,0:04:20.27,英文,,0,0,0,,But Isaac, you say, this isn't a game yet, we're just rendering a circle.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.92,0:04:23.20,英文,,0,0,0,,That's where you're wrong. Are you ready for this?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.56,0:04:25.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's right. Input handling.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.88,0:04:27.94,英文,,0,0,0,,We're going to make our circle move.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.36,0:04:29.88,英文,,0,0,0,,Not to make it too complicated, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.08,0:04:34.66,英文,,0,0,0,,For our example, we're just going to be making our circle respond to basic WASD key presses.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.92,0:04:37.92,英文,,0,0,0,,We'll be taking advantage of Bevy's built-in input hooks,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.92,0:04:40.51,英文,,0,0,0,,but other libraries do exist that extract this away a bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.92,0:04:43.42,英文,,0,0,0,,To start out with, let's make another new system.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.74,0:04:47.32,英文,,0,0,0,,This system has a query that returns transform components,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.32,0:04:49.47,英文,,0,0,0,,which include position and rotation data.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.84,0:04:54.58,英文,,0,0,0,,Specifically, we only want transform components from entities that also have a player component.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.88,0:04:56.02,英文,,0,0,0,,Remember, when we made that?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.33,0:04:58.80,英文,,0,0,0,,It's nothing special, and doesn't even store data.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.96,0:05:02.37,英文,,0,0,0,,We can use empty components like this as marker components,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.52,0:05:06.77,英文,,0,0,0,,which make it easier to select specific kinds of entities, like our player entity here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.33,0:05:10.91,英文,,0,0,0,,Next, we're going to loop through all the entities that this query gives us.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.00,0:05:13.72,英文,,0,0,0,,Obviously, this will just be one player in this instance,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.72,0:05:17.18,英文,,0,0,0,,but you can use this with things that may have many entities, or even none.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.80,0:05:21.12,英文,,0,0,0,,We need to know what buttons are being pressed in order to respond to them,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.12,0:05:23.12,英文,,0,0,0,,so we'll go ahead and add another parameter.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.12,0:05:27.68,英文,,0,0,0,,This isn't a query, but instead gets a reference to the button input resource within Bevy.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.32,0:05:31.24,英文,,0,0,0,,We'll also add a direction vector at the start of our loop,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.24,0:05:34.80,英文,,0,0,0,,as well as the code to use that vector to update where our player is.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.08,0:05:38.72,英文,,0,0,0,,Notice we've made a "move speed" constant up above our function.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.88,0:05:40.17,英文,,0,0,0,,You don't have to do this,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.29,0:05:43.73,英文,,0,0,0,,but I personally prefer to avoid nameless magic numbers in my code.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.56,0:05:48.54,英文,,0,0,0,,Finally, it's time to write the code that determines where our player is moving towards.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.78,0:05:50.29,英文,,0,0,0,,This part is relatively straightforward.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.78,0:05:55.84,英文,,0,0,0,,Just check if a key is pressed, and if it is, nudge the direction in the appropriate direction.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.40,0:06:00.37,英文,,0,0,0,,You'll note that we check both key directions, even if we've already detected one.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.79,0:06:03.50,英文,,0,0,0,,This means that if you were to hold down both A and D,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.63,0:06:08.08,英文,,0,0,0,,your player wouldn't move horizontally, rather than one direction overriding the other.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.33,0:06:12.14,英文,,0,0,0,,This may or may not be how you want your player to move, but it's easily changeable.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.74,0:06:17.36,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's add our new system to our game, this time running under the update system.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.58,0:06:20.14,英文,,0,0,0,,The update system will run on every frame.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.56,0:06:22.54,英文,,0,0,0,,Let us witness the fruits of our labor.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.02,0:06:23.79,英文,,0,0,0,,Success.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.98,0:06:27.49,英文,,0,0,0,,We are now able to move our circle around on the screen, and even off it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.00,0:06:30.82,英文,,0,0,0,,Obviously there's more to game design than knowing how to move a circle around,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.82,0:06:35.12,英文,,0,0,0,,but sometimes the technical side is the hardest part to break into, so hopefully this helped you out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.63,0:06:39.92,英文,,0,0,0,,Here are some really good resources that I took advantage of when I was first getting started in Bevy.
