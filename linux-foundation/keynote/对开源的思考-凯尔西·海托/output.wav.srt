1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
 Today represents a first for me.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,160
 After a 25 year career, this is the first time I've ever worn a sports jacket in a professional

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,560
 setting.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,560
 How does it look?

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,200
 I bought this thing on Friday.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,380
 And when you buy a sports coat from the store, you know, they sell these things to anybody,

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,600
 they're not made for you.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,000
 The sleeves came all the way down to my knuckles.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,720
 And my wife, realizing that I was not going to have enough time to get it tailored, she's

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,800
 like, it looks fine.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,460
 I'm standing in the mirror, feeling like I was a seven-year-old wearing his father's

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,680
 jacket.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,100
 And I got desperate.

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,060
 On Sunday, I'm Googling for someone that can do alterations.

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,600
 And all I see is closed, closed, opens on Tuesday.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,560
 And I'm like, I don't have a chance.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,160
 And about 15 miles away from my home, there was a person that was open until 9:00.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,180
 And I'm a little worried that why are you open until 9:00 on a Sunday?

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,280
 Aren't you busy all week that you need time off?

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
 There's a reason why he's open when no one else is.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,620
 But I had to take my chances.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,860
 So I get in my car.

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,180
 Before getting in our car, I did call.

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,560
 And I said, hey, how much?

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,700
 How much and how long to tailor a men's suit, sports coat?

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,700
 He was like, a week.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,000
 And I was like, I need it much sooner than that.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 He said, two days.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,080
 I said, you're getting close.

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,800
 I need it today.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,500
 He was like, ah, you got to pick it up by 4:00.

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 So I drove down there.

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,340
 And he told me $20.

34
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,860
 I'm really getting nervous now.

35
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
 And I pull up.

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,520
 And it's a house.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,580
 It's a normal neighborhood.

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,480
 No storefront.

39
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,520
 No fancy signage.

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,700
 And he opened the door with no shoes on.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,000
 And I'm thinking to myself, I'm not getting this suit back

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,740
 if I leave it here.

43
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,700
 But you only live once.

44
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,900
 So I walk in.

45
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,000
 And I saw the sewing machines in the corner.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,220
 So I'm like, all right, it's getting a little legit.

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,280
 I see other garments waiting to be tailored.

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,480
 Maybe I am in the right place.

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,240
 And he hung it up on a string hanging from the ceiling.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,040
 And it twirled around.

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,780
 I'm like, what are you doing?

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,440
 And he asked me to put the jacket on.

53
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,820
 And I was like, what do you think?

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,400
 He was like, yeah, you definitely need

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,460
 to take it down an inch or so.

56
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,740
 And so I leave the jacket with him.

57
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,620
 And I come back.

58
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,800
 And I put the jacket on.

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
 And here's the thing.

60
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,800
 The name of this place is Sonny and Linda's Alterations.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,440
 That's his American name.

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,480
 He didn't speak English that well.

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,840
 And he did his best to make me feel comfortable.

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,280
 I put the jacket on.

65
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,380
 And that's when I learned that language is universal.

66
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,780
 Watch how I use it.

67
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,800
 Silence and a smile is the same in every language.

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,900
 And I put this jacket on.

69
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,260
 And it reminded me something.

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,380
 We live in a fairly open society where

71
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,740
 I can buy a jacket that wasn't quite made for me.

72
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,400
 And he possessed it.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,680
 And he had the skill, through open knowledge,

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,380
 to tailor it for my exact needs.

75
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,680
 In the software world, we call this patches or features

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,020
 or bug fixes.

77
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,380
 But he made it perfect just for me.

78
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,160
 And I smiled.

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,400
 And I gave him $60.

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
 And he was so happy.

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,320
 The first thing he said, this is too much money.

82
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,080
 It's only $20.

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,800
 I said, you can keep it.

84
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,120
 The jacket's perfect.

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,300
 And he smiled like a child.

86
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,360
 And he held the $60 close to his chest.

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,120
 He said, I'm taking the family out to dinner tonight.

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:11,180
 And the world is filled of these hidden maintainers.

89
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,540
 No one really knows their names.

90
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,080
 They don't work for a big, fancy company.

91
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,360
 But they do their best to make sure that we get

92
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,560
 to use the things that work for us.

93
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,700
 All those bug fixes, all those GitHub issues,

94
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,320
 there's a silent league of maintainers out here

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,400
 doing that kind of work, tailor fitting our software

96
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
 for our own needs.

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,600
 When we think about what it takes

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,140
 to deliver on some of this software,

99
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,140
 I think we're in this really pivotal point.

100
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,440
 Because open source has been such this powerful thing that

101
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,820
 we sometimes, I think, take it for granted.

102
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,900
 It's tricky.

103
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,380
 I want you to go through a thought experiment.

104
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,100
 Imagine if you had been diagnosed

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,280
 with an untreatable disease, not even curable.

106
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,200
 Untreatable.

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,360
 And so you decide to dedicate your entire life work

108
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,660
 to this disease.

109
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,600
 And the good news is you don't have to start from scratch.

110
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,700
 You get to rely on previous science.

111
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,320
 You get to use very mature machines, microscopes.

112
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,960
 You get to read all the research papers that came before you.

113
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,160
 And then you find a solution.

114
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,700
 You've done it.

115
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,060
 You can finally save yourself.

116
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,240
 You have to make a pivotal decision.

117
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,340
 Do you keep this formula for yourself?

118
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,100
 Or do you decide to share with other people?

119
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,920
 Now, there is no right answer here.

120
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,620
 Because why not capitalize on all the value

121
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,480
 that you've just now introduced to the world?

122
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,480
 Isn't it only fair that you get to capitalize from this?

123
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,400
 I'm pretty sure some of you in the audience

124
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,100
 would be like, who in their right mind would miss out

125
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,200
 on an opportunity to make billions of dollars from their own

126
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,660
 invention?

127
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,240
 Well, if you look around the room here today,

128
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,620
 those people are sitting next to you.

129
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,260
 Think about some of these global projects

130
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,340
 that we have that the very same maintainers could have easily

131
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,380
 chosen to start a company and go the proprietary route

132
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,460
 and keep it all for themselves.

133
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,060
 But instead, they chose to open source and stand

134
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,180
 behind those projects and make it available to all.

135
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,160
 It's a very tricky place to be, and I don't think there's a perfect answer.

136
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,740
 I don't think there's a perfect answer for this.

137
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,360
 So I have a lot of empathy with companies, contributors,

138
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,920
 and maintainers that are struggling with,

139
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,360
 how long can I do this for?

140
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,160
 We hear about open source sustainability,

141
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,980
 but I'm not quite sure people understand what this means.

142
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,580
 I've been an open source contributor for a while.

143
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,920
 And there's this saying, if you're

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,160
 the smartest person in the room, then you're in the wrong room,

145
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,120
 and you should leave.

146
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
 But eventually, if we all did that, then the room

147
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
 would be in the wrong place.

148
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,320
 And when I got into open source, those smart people

149
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,800
 didn't leave the room.

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,420
 They chose to collaborate instead.

151
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,740
 They even made a seat for me.

152
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,820
 I sat down, didn't know what I was doing, didn't know how to contribute,

153
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,420
 didn't know the workflow process.

154
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,300
 But they figured out a way to make it so.

155
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,960
 The documentation, the code reviews.

156
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,360
 This is what happens when the smart people stay in the room.

157
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,860
 So one day, I got to return the favor.

158
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,080
 I remember I open sourced my first project.

159
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,320
 It was called CompD.

160
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,320
 It wasn't super popular, but it did make its way around the world.

161
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,200
 I remember going to an open source conference in Europe,

162
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,520
 a conference called FOSDEM.

163
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,420
 And I'm standing in the back of this room.

164
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,580
 And there is someone that I don't know that was given

165
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,320
 a presentation about CompD.

166
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,580
 They had all these wonderful things to say.

167
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,840
 I'm in the back just smiling my ass off.

168
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
 I'm not quite famous.

169
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,880
 But people know who I am.

170
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,760
 Or at least they're aware of the work that I do.

171
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,500
 And they went on to tell the audience of how it was so important

172
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,960
 that I chose not only to scratch my own itch,

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,620
 but I also helped them with theirs.

174
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,760
 I felt really good about that project.

175
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,060
 And so as a maintainer, I went home and said,

176
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,540
 let me add more features.

177
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,800
 Let me fix a few bugs.

178
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,100
 I'm now more motivated than ever.

179
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,000
 You've got to be careful when you're a maintainer motivated to that degree.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,680
 Because you can hide burnout underneath the cloth of success.

181
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,880
 It's really easy to do.

182
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,120
 And I remember there was a time when I said no for the first time.

183
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,180
 See, what CompD does, it takes data from key value stores

184
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,040
 like etcd, a database.

185
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,760
 And there was a new company on the scene--

186
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,500
 they'd been around for a while--

187
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,640
 called HashiCorp.

188
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,420
 I had been a contributor to HashiCorp.

189
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,400
 And they've contributed to my project, CompD.

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,960
 What's supposed to happen?

191
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,400
 And one day, they introduced a new product called Volt.

192
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,020
 And I said, hey, I have no interest as a maintainer

193
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,600
 integrating with that product.

194
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,840
 But for them, this was a very important product.

195
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,460
 And they would like CompD to support it.

196
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,760
 Because at this point, CompD had become somewhat popular.

197
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,240
 And they were recommending it to their community.

198
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,360
 But here I was saying no.

199
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,940
 So when you say no as a maintainer, something has to give.

200
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,920
 How do we resolve issues when there's a--

201
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,040
 a conflict or a difference of opinion?

202
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,360
 Well, in this scenario, they chose

203
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,200
 to make another project, a clone of mine.

204
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,080
 And if you're a maintainer, you realize

205
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,740
 that at the top of that GitHub repository,

206
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,400
 there's the fork button.

207
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,200
 Anyone can click it and settle disputes without any arguments.

208
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
 I woke up one day, and they had a new project

209
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,520
 called Console Template.

210
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,880
 And they posted it.

211
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,840
 And it was at the top of Hacker News.

212
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,180
 And I'm sitting there smiling.

213
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,120
 But the internet can't see that.

214
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,000
 So in my defense, this thing rises to the top spot

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
 on Hacker News.

216
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,800
 How dare big, evil HashiCorp take Kelsey's work

217
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,600
 and rebrand it as their own?

218
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,260
 They should have just contributed back.

219
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,840
 There was no need for a competing project.

220
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
 I'm reading this as like, oh, they don't understand

221
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,680
 what has happened.

222
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,260
 When you get to the point where you can influence someone else

223
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,080
 to produce something else, this is also an achievement.

224
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,640
 And so I replied, this is open source.

225
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,860
 This is what's supposed to happen.

226
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,120
 Do you think that I did all of this work by myself?

227
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,600
 There were some of the largest contributors.

228
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,660
 I didn't invent the programming language

229
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,800
 that CompD is written in.

230
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,620
 I didn't invent the operating system

231
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,040
 that CompD is written in.

232
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,640
 If you zoom out, we've been in this together this whole time.

233
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,460
 And so I applaud the efforts for this new project to exist.

234
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,800
 And I'm quite flattered that this larger company decided

235
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,420
 to take inspiration from me.

236
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,320
 And I will go on to speak at a number of their conferences,

237
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,200
 because that's what good community members do.

238
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,760
 Even when we compete, we still find rooms to collaborate.

239
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,220
 And I remember one time I was collaborating

240
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,740
 with that particular company, HashiCorp.

241
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,080
 And I'm doing this keynote.

242
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,000
 And they gave me one of their HashiCorp shirts.

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,800
 My last name is Hightower.

244
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,720
 And their logo has this wonderful H. And I put it on.

245
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,920
 It says, the H stands for Hightower.

246
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,460
 And I wore it proudly on that keynote stage.

247
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,520
 And I remember having this shirt on.

248
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,420
 After the final keynote that I gave,

249
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,820
 they did a company-wide picture.

250
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,620
 At this point, HashiCorp grows to about, I don't know,

251
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,720
 300 to 400 people.

252
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,080
 And they all line up on the stage.

253
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,380
 And we take photos.

254
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,100
 And they're like, one of the founders, Mitchell Hashimoto,

255
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,580
 Kelsey, get in the photo.

256
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,880
 You're like family.

257
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,260
 So I get into the photo.

258
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,720
 And I stand there and I pose with my H on.

259
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,160
 And I straighten it out just so it looks perfect.

260
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,800
 And we take the photo.

261
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,320
 And I was like, Mitchell, this is our chance

262
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,620
 to do the funniest thing ever.

263
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,960
 It's like, what do you have in mind?

264
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,060
 And you post the photo on Twitter.

265
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,680
 And as the CEO and founder of HashiCorp,

266
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,520
 he wrote, I'm so happy that Kelsey is joining HashiCorp.

267
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:37,700
 Now, as an executive myself at Google,

268
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
 this is really interesting.

269
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,980
 And I let it bake for hours.

270
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,520
 The HR department is like, what's going on?

271
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,540
 When did Kelsey leave?

272
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
 When you work with almost 200,000 people,

273
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,780
 no one knows what's going on.

274
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,640
 So people were emailing me like, congratulations.

275
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,140
 I think.

276
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,300
 And you just start typing, but never send anything.

277
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,780
 So it was just dot, dot, dot.

278
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,180
 So after a couple of hours, because it started

279
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,320
 getting really serious, you know it's

280
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,700
 serious when your VP puts a meeting on your calendar

281
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,060
 to discuss things.

282
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,260
 So I declined the meeting.

283
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,520
 I was like, it's a joke.

284
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,780
 And I responded, but HashiCorp is like family.

285
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,600
 And I remember during that time, I had this friend.

286
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,100
 He was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

287
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,600
 And I was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

288
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
 And he was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

289
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 And I was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

290
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 And he was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

291
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
 And I was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

292
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 And he was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

293
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
 And I was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

294
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
 And he was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

295
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 And I was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

296
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 And he was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

297
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 And I was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

298
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 And he was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

299
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
 And I was like, I'm going to be your CEO.

300
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,960
 what they go through. I also advise lots of startups, and they all have this sentiment that

301
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,560
 seems to be pretty new. From the outsider's view, the early days of open source seemed to try to

302
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,200
 make better versions of things that existed already. Some of the earlier operating systems,

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,360
 Cornshell to Bash, there was a blueprint and a template, and the goal was to turn proprietary

304
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,600
 software and make it open. And of course, they got better over time to the point where they became

305
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,880
 industry standards. But imagine trying to build a company in this era. This is an extreme amount

306
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,660
 of challenge. If you're a small company or a startup, how do you sell something that you give

307
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:31,240
 away completely for free? I don't have a perfect answer for that. I don't think the answer is

308
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,640
 changing your license. That's not going to work, folks. You're going to have to do something better

309
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,580
 than that. You're going to have to do something better than that. You're going to have to do

310
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,860
 something just like Mike Taylor did. You're going to have to figure out how to offer value

311
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:50,260
 in an open ecosystem. Because if you don't, someone else will figure out a way to do it

312
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,040
 instead. The question I like to leave with all the founders and customers out there that are

313
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,940
 struggling with this, we have to ask ourselves, what is the moat that they need to build? And my

314
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:09,280
 response to that is, why are you trying to build a moat in the age of flight? That is not a

315
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:16,100
 sustainable path. We're going to have to figure out how to collaborate on equal terms. Now, a lot of

316
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,400
 you are going to go out and enjoy the next two days of this conference, and I want to leave you with

317
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,080
 one more phrase. When you're thinking about whether you should contribute or not, whether you

318
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,620
 should try that new idea and make it open, one phrase that I always return to in moments like

319
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:39,540
 this is, there are some people that have ideas, and there are some ideas that have people. And

320
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
 Thank you.

321
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,020
 Thank you.
