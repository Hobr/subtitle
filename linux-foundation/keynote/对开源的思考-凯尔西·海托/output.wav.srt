1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
 Today represents a first for me.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,160
 After a 25 year career, this is the first time I've ever worn a sports jacket in a professional

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,560
 setting.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,560
 How does it look?

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,600
 I bought this thing on Friday, and when you buy a sports coat from the store, you know,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,600
 they sell these things to anybody, they're not made for you.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,980
 The sleeves came all the way down to my knuckles.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,780
 And my wife, realizing that I was not going to have enough time to get it tailored, she's

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,780
 like, "It looks fine."

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,460
 And I'm standing in the mirror, feeling like I was a seven year old wearing his father's

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,660
 jacket.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,100
 And I got desperate.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:55,960
 On Sunday, I'm Googling for someone that can do alterations, and all I see is closed, closed,

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
 opens on Tuesday.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,540
 And I'm like, "I don't have a chance."

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:06,160
 And about 15 miles away from my home, there was a person that was open till 9:00.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,160
 And I'm a little worried that, why are you open till 9:00 on a Sunday?

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,280
 Aren't you busy all week that you need time off?

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
 There's a reason why he's open when no one else is.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,620
 But I had to take my chances.

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,860
 So I get in my car.

22
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,480
 Before getting in our car, I did call.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
 And I said, "Hey, how much?"

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,680
 "And how long to tailor a men's suit, sports coat?"

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
 He was like, "A week."

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,980
 And I was like, "I need it much sooner than that."

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,980
 He said, "Two days."

28
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,040
 And I said, "You're getting close."

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,760
 "I need it today."

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,460
 He was like, "Ah, you got to pick it up by 4:00."

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,320
 So I drove down there, and he told me $20.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,820
 I'm really getting nervous now.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,420
 And I pull up, and it's a house in a normal neighborhood.

34
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,540
 No storefront, no fancy signage.

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,720
 And he opened the door with no shoes on.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,360
 And I'm thinking to myself, I'm not getting this suit back if I leave it here.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
 But you only live once.

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,720
 So I walk in, and I saw the sewing machines in the corner.

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,140
 So I'm like, all right, it's getting a little legit.

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,480
 I see other garments waiting to be tailored.

41
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,520
 Maybe I am in the right place.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
 And he hung it up.

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,300
 on a string hanging from the ceiling. And it twirled around. I'm like, what are you doing?

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,200
 And he asked me to put the jacket on. And I was like, what do you think? He was like, yeah,

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,640
 you definitely need to take it down an inch or so. And so I leave the jacket with him.

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:52,440
 And I come back. And I put the jacket on. And here's the thing. The name of this place is

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:59,300
 Bethany and Linda's Alterations. That's his American name. He didn't speak English that well.

48
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:07,240
 And he did his best to make me feel comfortable. I put the jacket on. And that's when I learned

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:15,700
 that language is universal. Watch how I use it. Silence and a smile is the same in every language.

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,960
 And I put this jacket on. And it reminded me something.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,700
 We live in a fairly open society.

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,180
 We live in a society where I can buy a jacket that wasn't quite made for me.

53
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,800
 And he possessed the skill through open knowledge to tailor it for my exact needs.

54
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,980
 In the software world, we call this patches or features or bug fixes. But he made it perfect

55
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,780
 just for me. And I smiled. And I gave him $60. And he was so happy. The first thing he said,

56
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:51,780
 this is too much money. It's only $20. I said, you can keep it. The jacket's perfect.

57
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:59,180
 And he smiled like a child. And he held the $60 close to his chest. He said, I'm taking the family

58
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,080
 out to dinner tonight.

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:12,500
 And the world is filled of these hidden maintainers. No one really knows their names.

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,640
 They don't work for a big, fancy company. But they do their best to make sure that we

61
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,020
 get to use the things that work for us.

62
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:26,760
 All those bug fixes, all those GitHub issues, there's a silent league of maintainers out here

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,220
 doing that kind of work, tailor-fitting our software for our own needs.

64
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,580
 When we think about what it takes to deliver on some of this software, I think we're in this

65
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,800
 really pivotal point. Because open source has been such this powerful thing that we sometimes,

66
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,340
 I think, take it for granted. It's tricky. I want you to go through a thought experiment.

67
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,000
 Imagine if you had a thought experiment. And you had a thought experiment. And you had a thought

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
 experiment. And you had a thought experiment. And you had a thought experiment. And you had

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:00,400
 been diagnosed with an untreatable disease. Not even curable, untreatable. And so you decide to

70
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,500
 dedicate your entire life work to this disease. And the good news is you don't have to start from

71
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:15,000
 scratch. You get to rely on previous science. You get to use very mature machines, microscopes.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,100
 You get to read all the research papers that came before you. And then you find a solution.

73
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:29,420
 you've done it you can finally save yourself you have to make a pivotal decision do you keep this

74
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:37,180
 formula for yourself or do you decide to share with other people that there is no right answer

75
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,400
 here because why not capitalize on all the value that you've just now introduced to the world

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,460
 isn't it only fair that you get to capitalize from this i'm pretty sure some of you in the

77
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,240
 audience would be like who in their right mind would miss out on an opportunity to make billions

78
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,780
 of dollars from their own invention well if you look around the room here today those people are

79
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,600
 sitting next to you think about some of these global projects that we have that the very same

80
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,760
 maintainers could have easily chosen to start a company and go to proprietary route and keep it

81
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,820
 all for themselves but instead they chose to open source

82
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:25,700
 and stand behind those projects and make it available to all it's a very tricky place to be

83
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,820
 and i don't think there's a perfect answer for this so i have a lot of empathy with companies

84
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,080
 contributors and maintainers that are struggling with how long can i do this for we hear about

85
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,540
 open source sustainability but i'm not quite sure people understand what this means

86
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:48,180
 i've been an open source contributor for a while and there's this saying if you're the

87
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,220
 smartest person in the room then you're in the wrong room and you should leave

88
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:59,180
 but eventually if we all did that then the room would be empty and when i got into open source

89
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,220
 those smart people didn't leave the room they chose to collaborate instead they even made a

90
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,040
 seat for me i sat down didn't know what i was doing didn't know how to contribute didn't know

91
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,160
 the workflow process but they figured out a way to make it so the documentation the code reviews

92
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,540
 this is what happens

93
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,140
 when the smart people stay in the room

94
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:28,820
 so one day i got to return the favor i remember i open sourced my first project CompD

95
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:38,760
 wasn't super popular but it did make its way around the world i remember going to an open source conference in europe conference called FOSDEM

96
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:46,900
 and i'm standing in the back of this room and there is someone that i don't know that was given a presentation about CompD

97
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,660
 they had all these wonderful things to say i'm in the back just smiling my ass off

98
00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:01,460
 i'm not quite famous but people know who i am or at least they're aware of the work that i do

99
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,900
 and they went on to tell the audience of how it was so important that i chose not only to scratch

100
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:14,500
 my own itch but i also helped them with theirs i felt really good about that project and so as a

101
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:21,540
 maintainer i went home and said let me add more features let me fix a few bugs i'm now more motivated

102
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,180
 than ever you got to be careful when you're a maintainer motivated to that degree because you

103
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,740
 can hide burnout underneath the cloth of success it's really easy to do and i remember there was a

104
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:42,020
 time when i said no for the first time see what CompD does it takes data from key value stores

105
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,700
 like etcd a database and there was a new company on the scene they've been around for a while

106
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,100
 called hashicorp i had been a contributor to hashicorp and they've contributed to my project

107
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:02,900
 CompD what's supposed to happen and one day they introduced a new product called volt and i said hey

108
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:09,780
 i have no interest as a maintainer integrating with that product but for them this is a very

109
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,380
 important product and they would like CompD to support it because at this point CompD had become

110
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,340
 somewhat popular and they were recommending it to their community but here i was saying no

111
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,700
 so when you say no as a maintainer something has to give

112
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,900
 how do we resolve issues when there's a conflict or a difference of opinion

113
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:37,060
 well in this scenario they chose to make another project a clone of mine if you're a maintainer

114
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,620
 you realize that at the top of that github repository there's the fork button anyone

115
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,220
 can click it and settle disputes without any arguments i woke up one day and they had a new

116
00:09:51,220 --> 00:10:00,020
 project called console template and they posted it and it was at the top of hacker news and i'm

117
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,900
 sitting there smiling but the internet can't see that so in my defense

118
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:13,860
 this thing rises to the top spot on hacker news how dare big evil hashi corp

119
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,020
 take kelsey's work and rebrand it as their own

120
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:24,420
 they should have just contributed back there was no need for a competing project

121
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,580
 and i'm reading this as like oh they don't understand what has happened

122
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:36,420
 when you get to the point where you can influence someone else to produce something

123
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:45,060
 else this is also an achievement and so i replied this is open source this is what's supposed to

124
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,380
 happen do you think that i did all of this work by myself there were some of the largest contributors

125
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,140
 i didn't invent the programming language that comp d is written in i didn't invent

126
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:05,780
 the operating system that comp d is written in if you zoom out we've been in this together this whole

127
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,340
 time

128
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,260
 and so i applaud the efforts for this new project to exist and i'm quite flattered that this larger

129
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:20,340
 company decided to take inspiration from me and i will go on to speak at a number of their conferences

130
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:26,180
 because that's what good community members do even when we compete we still find rooms to collaborate

131
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:33,860
 and i remember one time i was collaborating with that particular company hashi corp and i'm doing

132
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,060
 this keynote and they gave me one of their hashi corp shirts my last name is hightower and their

133
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:45,060
 logo has this wonderful h and i put it on says the h stands for hightower now we're proudly on that

134
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,900
 keynote stage and i remember having this shirt on after the final keynote that i gave they did

135
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,860
 a company-wide picture at this point hashi corp grows to about i don't know three to four hundred

136
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,140
 people and they all line up on the stage and we take photos and they're like one of the founders

137
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,700
 mitchell hashimoto kelsey get in the front row kelsey get in the front row kelsey get in the front

138
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,700
 row you're in the photo you're like family so i get into the photo and i stand there and i pose

139
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,340
 with my h on and i straighten it out just so it looks perfect and we take the photo and i was like

140
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,780
 mitchell this is our chance to do the funniest thing ever it's like what do you have in mind

141
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,100
 and he posts the photo on twitter and as the ceo and founder of hashi corp

142
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,340
 he wrote i'm so happy that kelsey is joining hashi corp

143
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:38,660
 now as an executive myself at google this is really interesting

144
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:48,340
 and i let it bake for hours the hr department is like what's going on when did kelsey leave

145
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,620
 when you work with almost 200 000 people no one knows what's going on

146
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,300
 so people were emailing me like congratulations i think

147
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,340
 and you just

148
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,660
 start typing but never send anything so she says dot dot dot

149
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,060
 so after a couple of hours because it started getting really serious

150
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,580
 you know it's serious when your vp puts a meeting on your calendar to discuss things

151
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:24,580
 so i declined the meeting is like it's a joke and i responded but hashi corp is like family

152
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,540
 and i remember during that time i had this phrase different company same team

153
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,580
 that's how i've always thought about this open source collaboration and i've contributed to

154
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,220
 many of the hashi core projects and the reason why i'm bringing up hashi corp in particular because

155
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,420
 i have a lot of empathy for my family and what they go through i also advise lots of startups

156
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:51,060
 and they all have this sentiment that seems to be pretty new from the outsider's view the early days

157
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,980
 of open source seem to try to make better versions of things that existed already some of the earlier

158
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,180
 operating systems corn shell tobacco and other things i've always thought about this open source

159
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:07,140
 was a blueprint and a template and the goal was to turn proprietary software and make it open and of

160
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,860
 course they got better over time to the point where they became industry standards but imagine

161
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:19,620
 trying to build a company in this error this is an extreme amount of challenge if you're a small

162
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:27,860
 company or startup how do you sell something that you give away completely for free i don't have a

163
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:34,660
 perfect answer for that i don't think the answer is changing your license that's not going to work

164
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,940
 folks you're going to have to do something better than that you're going to have to do something

165
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:46,180
 just like my taylor did you're going to have to figure out how to offer value in an open ecosystem

166
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,420
 because if you don't someone else will figure out a way to do it instead the question i'd like

167
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,740
 to leave with all the founders and customers out there that are struggling with this

168
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:03,620
 we have to ask ourselves what is the moat that they need to build and my response to that is why

169
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:11,380
 are you trying to build a moat in the age of flight that is not a sustainable path we're going to have

170
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,140
 to figure out how to collaborate on equal terms now a lot of you are going to go out and enjoy

171
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,820
 the next two days of this conference and i want to leave you with one more phrase when you're

172
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,620
 thinking about whether you should contribute or not whether you should try that new idea and make

173
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,020
 it open you're going to have to figure out how to collaborate on equal terms now a lot of you are going to go out and enjoy the next two days of this conference and i want to leave you with one more phrase when you're thinking about whether you should contribute or not whether you should try that new idea and make it open

174
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:33,060
 one phrase that i always return to in moments like this is there are some people that have ideas

175
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:42,820
 and there are some ideas that have people and don't forget that last part thank you
