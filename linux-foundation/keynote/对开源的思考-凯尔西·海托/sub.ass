Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.58,0:04:43.80,英文,,0,0,0,,really pivotal point. Because open source has been such this powerful thing that we sometimes,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.80,0:04:49.34,英文,,0,0,0,,I think, take it for granted. It's tricky. I want you to go through a thought experiment.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.50,0:05:15.00,英文,,0,0,0,,scratch. You get to rely on previous science. You get to use very mature machines, microscopes.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.76,0:06:18.82,英文,,0,0,0,,all for themselves but instead they chose to open source
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.82,0:06:25.70,英文,,0,0,0,,and stand behind those projects and make it available to all it's a very tricky place to be
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.70,0:06:30.82,英文,,0,0,0,,and i don't think there's a perfect answer for this so i have a lot of empathy with companies
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.82,0:06:38.08,英文,,0,0,0,,contributors and maintainers that are struggling with how long can i do this for we hear about
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.08,0:06:41.54,英文,,0,0,0,,open source sustainability but i'm not quite sure people understand what this means
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.54,0:06:48.18,英文,,0,0,0,,i've been an open source contributor for a while and there's this saying if you're the
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.18,0:06:52.22,英文,,0,0,0,,smartest person in the room then you're in the wrong room and you should leave
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.22,0:06:59.18,英文,,0,0,0,,but eventually if we all did that then the room would be empty and when i got into open source
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.18,0:07:05.22,英文,,0,0,0,,those smart people didn't leave the room they chose to collaborate instead they even made a
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.22,0:07:10.04,英文,,0,0,0,,seat for me i sat down didn't know what i was doing didn't know how to contribute didn't know
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.04,0:07:16.16,英文,,0,0,0,,the workflow process but they figured out a way to make it so the documentation the code reviews
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.16,0:07:17.54,英文,,0,0,0,,this is what happens
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.54,0:07:22.14,英文,,0,0,0,,when the smart people stay in the room
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.14,0:07:28.82,英文,,0,0,0,,so one day i got to return the favor i remember i open sourced my first project CompD
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.82,0:07:38.76,英文,,0,0,0,,wasn't super popular but it did make its way around the world i remember going to an open source conference in europe conference called FOSDEM
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.76,0:07:46.90,英文,,0,0,0,,and i'm standing in the back of this room and there is someone that i don't know that was given a presentation about CompD
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.90,0:07:52.66,英文,,0,0,0,,they had all these wonderful things to say i'm in the back just smiling my ass off
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.66,0:08:01.46,英文,,0,0,0,,i'm not quite famous but people know who i am or at least they're aware of the work that i do
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.46,0:08:06.90,英文,,0,0,0,,and they went on to tell the audience of how it was so important that i chose not only to scratch
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.90,0:08:14.50,英文,,0,0,0,,my own itch but i also helped them with theirs i felt really good about that project and so as a
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.50,0:08:21.54,英文,,0,0,0,,maintainer i went home and said let me add more features let me fix a few bugs i'm now more motivated
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.54,0:08:28.18,英文,,0,0,0,,than ever you got to be careful when you're a maintainer motivated to that degree because you
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.18,0:08:34.74,英文,,0,0,0,,can hide burnout underneath the cloth of success it's really easy to do and i remember there was a
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.74,0:08:42.02,英文,,0,0,0,,time when i said no for the first time see what CompD does it takes data from key value stores
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.02,0:08:47.70,英文,,0,0,0,,like etcd a database and there was a new company on the scene they've been around for a while
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.70,0:08:54.10,英文,,0,0,0,,called hashicorp i had been a contributor to hashicorp and they've contributed to my project
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.10,0:09:02.90,英文,,0,0,0,,CompD what's supposed to happen and one day they introduced a new product called volt and i said hey
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.90,0:09:09.78,英文,,0,0,0,,i have no interest as a maintainer integrating with that product but for them this is a very
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.78,0:09:15.38,英文,,0,0,0,,important product and they would like CompD to support it because at this point CompD had become
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.38,0:09:20.34,英文,,0,0,0,,somewhat popular and they were recommending it to their community but here i was saying no
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.34,0:09:23.70,英文,,0,0,0,,so when you say no as a maintainer something has to give
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.70,0:09:28.90,英文,,0,0,0,,how do we resolve issues when there's a conflict or a difference of opinion
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.90,0:09:37.06,英文,,0,0,0,,well in this scenario they chose to make another project a clone of mine if you're a maintainer
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.18,0:09:43.62,英文,,0,0,0,,you realize that at the top of that github repository there's the fork button anyone
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.62,0:09:51.22,英文,,0,0,0,,can click it and settle disputes without any arguments i woke up one day and they had a new
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.22,0:10:00.02,英文,,0,0,0,,project called console template and they posted it and it was at the top of hacker news and i'm
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.02,0:10:06.90,英文,,0,0,0,,sitting there smiling but the internet can't see that so in my defense
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.90,0:10:13.86,英文,,0,0,0,,this thing rises to the top spot on hacker news how dare big evil hashi corp
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.86,0:10:18.02,英文,,0,0,0,,take kelsey's work and rebrand it as their own
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.02,0:10:24.42,英文,,0,0,0,,they should have just contributed back there was no need for a competing project
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.42,0:10:28.58,英文,,0,0,0,,and i'm reading this as like oh they don't understand what has happened
Dialogue: 0,0:10:28.58,0:10:36.42,英文,,0,0,0,,when you get to the point where you can influence someone else to produce something
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.42,0:10:45.06,英文,,0,0,0,,else this is also an achievement and so i replied this is open source this is what's supposed to
Dialogue: 0,0:10:45.06,0:10:51.38,英文,,0,0,0,,happen do you think that i did all of this work by myself there were some of the largest contributors
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.38,0:10:57.14,英文,,0,0,0,,i didn't invent the programming language that comp d is written in i didn't invent
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.14,0:11:05.78,英文,,0,0,0,,the operating system that comp d is written in if you zoom out we've been in this together this whole
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.78,0:11:06.34,英文,,0,0,0,,time
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.34,0:11:12.26,英文,,0,0,0,,and so i applaud the efforts for this new project to exist and i'm quite flattered that this larger
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.26,0:11:20.34,英文,,0,0,0,,company decided to take inspiration from me and i will go on to speak at a number of their conferences
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.34,0:11:26.18,英文,,0,0,0,,because that's what good community members do even when we compete we still find rooms to collaborate
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.18,0:11:33.86,英文,,0,0,0,,and i remember one time i was collaborating with that particular company hashi corp and i'm doing
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.86,0:11:39.06,英文,,0,0,0,,this keynote and they gave me one of their hashi corp shirts my last name is hightower and their
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.06,0:11:45.06,英文,,0,0,0,,logo has this wonderful h and i put it on says the h stands for hightower now we're proudly on that
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.06,0:11:50.90,英文,,0,0,0,,keynote stage and i remember having this shirt on after the final keynote that i gave they did
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.90,0:11:55.86,英文,,0,0,0,,a company-wide picture at this point hashi corp grows to about i don't know three to four hundred
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.86,0:12:01.14,英文,,0,0,0,,people and they all line up on the stage and we take photos and they're like one of the founders
