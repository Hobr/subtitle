Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.55,0:09:10.83,英文,,0,0,0,,But for them this is a very important product.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.83,0:09:16.58,英文,,0,0,0,,And they would like CompD to support it because at this point CompD had become somewhat popular.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.75,0:09:18.89,英文,,0,0,0,,And they were recommending it to their community.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.16,0:09:20.75,英文,,0,0,0,,But here I was saying no.
