Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.70,0:07:48.02,Default,,0,0,0,,because we're in embedded, we're in mobile, we're in automotive, we're in data center, we're in HPC,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.16,0:07:55.38,Default,,0,0,0,,we're in hyperscale. We're following all of those threads at the same time. So while our numbers

Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.50,0:08:07.84,Default,,0,0,0,,hall today, we are rapidly accelerating our growth with our community. So this is our number of SOCs
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.84,0:08:14.96,Default,,0,0,0,,that are calculated. And we'll get to, well, how does that translate to the money in a minute?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.60,0:08:22.60,Default,,0,0,0,,But first, what fields are those in? We're seeing that AI is capitalizing across multiple different

Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.94,0:08:39.70,Default,,0,0,0,,are set to tip over into RISC-V in the coming years. This is huge. Now, remember, just about

Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.62,0:10:29.86,Default,,0,0,0,,turning to RISC-V for their strategy. So let's talk a little bit about what some of those
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.86,0:10:36.68,Default,,0,0,0,,processors are. So you can see here that we've seen a lot of activity from many of the folks in our

Dialogue: 0,0:12:44.64,0:12:53.76,Default,,0,0,0,,If you don't initiate that journey soon. So let's look at some of these industries in particular.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:53.76,0:13:02.60,Default,,0,0,0,,In automotive, nearly 30% of automotive will be RISC-V by 2030. If you're engaged in automotive,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:02.60,0:13:08.72,Default,,0,0,0,,it's not when, you know, what if RISC-V, it's when, and that when is already here.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.72,0:13:14.62,Default,,0,0,0,,So think about that across the many domains and areas just within automotive, and this
Dialogue: 0,0:13:14.62,0:13:23.74,Default,,0,0,0,,is something that you'll see is paramount as you look at safety and security and all the other elements that wrap into that.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.74,0:13:32.66,Default,,0,0,0,,In data center and cloud, you know, we've heard from some of our stakeholders like Meta and Google and others who have deep
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.66,0:13:44.60,Default,,0,0,0,,investments in RISC-V and some of the work and some of the challenges that they see and things that we as a community are tackling together. But look not just at primary application workloads, but
Dialogue: 0,0:13:44.60,0:13:52.78,Default,,0,0,0,,also at some of the related things around accelerating a workload or bringing AI onto that existing workload.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.78,0:13:59.44,Default,,0,0,0,,That's where many of the initial footprints in data center are today.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.44,0:14:14.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Looking more at telecom and consumer devices, 5G has ushered in a completely new era, not just for embedded and others involved here, but in particular for RISC-V. So this, you know, ranges from the
Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.58,0:14:26.88,Default,,0,0,0,,infrastructure behind mobile to the handset itself and bringing all the applications and related functionality within a handset as well. So, you know, it's interesting, the application
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.88,0:14:44.56,Default,,0,0,0,,processor is only one piece of that phone. Of the dozens of chips within each of your phones, many of those are tipping to RISC-V already. We already talked a little bit about the Internet of Things, but think of this also as
Dialogue: 0,0:14:44.56,0:15:14.54,Default,,0,0,0,,thinking about where does RISC-V fit in the security side of that story and streamlining the, you know, the various attributes that you need within that SOC and enabling that custom processing at a very low power threshold. So some of those low power aspects are things that are easily designed with RISC-V because of the number of variables that you can fine-tune in your design that you simply cannot
Dialogue: 0,0:15:14.54,0:15:16.54,Default,,0,0,0,,do with another architecture.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.54,0:15:44.52,Default,,0,0,0,,HPC. You know, HPC is one of the domains that you really truly have a full chip through software stack that is completely open, and that has been great in a lot of our research in academia. You also have the potential, because of reserved encoding space, to add in your custom extensions and proprietary mechanisms to achieve that differentiation that you're looking for.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:44.52,0:16:02.30,Default,,0,0,0,,We have already seen the first RISC-V clusters in competition. They may not have, you know, won the, you know, the golden trophy out the gate, but it is compelling and amazing to see how rapidly RISC-V has made it from embedded to HPC.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:02.30,0:16:32.28,Default,,0,0,0,,I mentioned ecosystem, and this is our landscape. The RISC-V ecosystem is something that, you know, spans from hardware and tool providers and, you know, these logos are going to get smaller and smaller on this chart as we try and get more in. But there is a dynamic version of this online that you can go in and have a look. You know, think about all of the different operating systems and other resources and things that have been used to make this possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:32.28,0:16:47.20,Default,,0,0,0,,And here's the operating systems row here. All the different aspects and all the different stakeholders in our ecosystem that need to come together. And by the way, if your logo needs to be on this map, let us know. We'll be sure to bring it on.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:47.20,0:17:00.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So think about how fast you've seen our ecosystem accelerating and what your role is in that community. Think about how are you participating? How are you showing up?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:02.26,0:17:23.78,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you're already a member of RISC-V, it's important to think about that. Because engaging shoulder to shoulder with the engineers and the top minds of this industry who are driving this complete revolution forward is the best way to accelerate your own development within your own companies or the work that you're doing in research or academia.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:32.24,0:17:55.66,Default,,0,0,0,,And that insight back into your company and that allows you to innovate faster. That has business value. It's not just to do something better, faster, more performant, lower power, but it also helps you win in the market. And that's really where research starts to transition into commercialization. And that's what we're seeing in RISC-V.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:55.66,0:18:02.22,Default,,0,0,0,,So for all of these stakeholders, they said, now is the time. Now is the time to push forward.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:02.22,0:18:07.66,Default,,0,0,0,,So for my investment, my resource into RISC-V, and they've started to realize the potential of that.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:07.66,0:18:17.72,Default,,0,0,0,,So thank you. Thank you for joining me today. And hopefully I'll see you in the community. And I invite you to engage there as well. Thank you.
