Dialogue: 1,0:00:00.00,0:00:10.76,英文,,0,0,0,,One little bit of news that recently dropped. There was an announcement that
Dialogue: 1,0:00:10.76,0:00:16.02,英文,,0,0,0,,in China the state organizations are going to be adopting RISC-V or at least
Dialogue: 1,0:00:16.02,0:00:20.34,英文,,0,0,0,,exploring it. Tell us a little bit about that. Well I can't speak to other
Dialogue: 1,0:00:20.34,0:00:25.08,英文,,0,0,0,,governments but you know we are seeing exponential growth of RISC-V around
Dialogue: 1,0:00:25.08,0:00:30.48,英文,,0,0,0,,the world. Last year we saw more than 25% growth year-over-year in our
Dialogue: 1,0:00:30.48,0:00:36.12,英文,,0,0,0,,membership. We're more than 4,300 members now which is probably even up a little
Dialogue: 1,0:00:36.12,0:00:40.62,英文,,0,0,0,,from our press release because we got last month's close. But we're seeing this
Dialogue: 1,0:00:40.62,0:00:46.08,英文,,0,0,0,,diversity of interest in RISC-V that's really profound. We've got about a
Dialogue: 1,0:00:46.08,0:00:51.32,英文,,0,0,0,,third of our members in North America, Europe, and APAC. Pretty evenly
Dialogue: 1,0:00:51.32,0:00:54.46,英文,,0,0,0,,distributed. And the really cool thing is I've been
Dialogue: 1,0:00:54.46,0:01:00.70,英文,,0,0,0,,saying that for five years. It hasn't changed. The level of interest is
Dialogue: 1,0:01:00.70,0:01:05.98,英文,,0,0,0,,continuing to skyrocket evenly and profoundly around the world and we're
Dialogue: 1,0:01:05.98,0:01:11.50,英文,,0,0,0,,adding into that new areas. So the Ministry of Brazil has just signed
Dialogue: 1,0:01:11.50,0:01:18.04,英文,,0,0,0,,agreements with the European Union and with you know working out things with
Dialogue: 1,0:01:18.04,0:01:23.84,英文,,0,0,0,,Spain and Portugal to do even more for Latin America and Spanish-speaking countries. So
Dialogue: 1,0:01:23.84,0:01:29.54,英文,,0,0,0,,the Ministry of Brazil has joined RISC-V and sit on our board now and that's
Dialogue: 1,0:01:29.54,0:01:33.62,英文,,0,0,0,,great because when it comes to you know kind of that government support, that
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.62,0:01:38.70,英文,,0,0,0,,federal support of RISC-V, it's really important. And whether I'm talking to the
Dialogue: 1,0:01:38.70,0:01:42.98,英文,,0,0,0,,European Union on the funds and grants that are going on for RISC-V or
Dialogue: 1,0:01:42.98,0:01:49.28,英文,,0,0,0,,countries like Brazil or India that are investing in RISC-V, the main thing here
Dialogue: 1,0:01:49.28,0:01:55.54,英文,,0,0,0,,is invest local. Shore up that local economy. Engage in the digital economy.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:55.54,0:01:59.60,英文,,0,0,0,,Teach computer science in all your universities and do it on RISC-V.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:59.60,0:02:05.24,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Rather than those other architectures. And what you're going to do
Dialogue: 1,0:02:05.24,0:02:10.74,英文,,0,0,0,,is engage that in the global economy. Don't do it for yourself. Do it in a
Dialogue: 1,0:02:10.74,0:02:14.94,英文,,0,0,0,,global way and that's why RISC-V as a standard is so important. Okay I've been
Dialogue: 1,0:02:14.94,0:02:18.96,英文,,0,0,0,,talking a lot. Your turn. Well look I look forward with this news about Brazil I
Dialogue: 1,0:02:18.96,0:02:24.84,英文,,0,0,0,,look forward to the RISC-V Carnival standard. That should be fun. What do you
Dialogue: 1,0:02:24.84,0:02:29.46,英文,,0,0,0,,what are some of the industries that are driving all of this growth? I mean I know
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.46,0:02:33.24,英文,,0,0,0,,that we've been talking a lot about automotive which is exciting and cool
Dialogue: 1,0:02:33.24,0:02:38.04,英文,,0,0,0,,but what are some of your other favorites? So yes, industries driving like
Dialogue: 1,0:02:38.04,0:02:44.10,英文,,0,0,0,,automotive. I didn't miss that. You know so embedded this is kind of where it
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.10,0:02:50.20,英文,,0,0,0,,started for RISC-V and we've started to really move up the compute spectrum into
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.20,0:02:56.64,英文,,0,0,0,,even more robust or performant workloads. So embedded is all about lightweight, low
Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.64,0:03:01.74,英文,,0,0,0,,power, portable, very you know single focus design and that has been an
Dialogue: 1,0:03:01.74,0:03:06.34,英文,,0,0,0,,incredible start and we're starting to see that grow into mobile. We've seen a
Dialogue: 1,0:03:06.34,0:03:13.06,英文,,0,0,0,,lot with Android coming onto the systems for or onto RISC-V for application
Dialogue: 1,0:03:13.06,0:03:18.64,英文,,0,0,0,,processing but that's not the only processor in your phone. You also have
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.64,0:03:23.38,英文,,0,0,0,,Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, all the other pieces and parts of your phone that you know
Dialogue: 1,0:03:23.38,0:03:28.36,英文,,0,0,0,,there's a lot of area there that everyone can take advantage of. You move
Dialogue: 1,0:03:28.36,0:03:34.44,英文,,0,0,0,,from there into you know tablets, laptops, we've got a couple of those here at the
Dialogue: 1,0:03:34.44,0:03:39.94,英文,,0,0,0,,show. You move from there into data center and the workloads that are
Dialogue: 1,0:03:39.94,0:03:43.96,英文,,0,0,0,,looking to come on to RISC-V and the data center is already pretty profound.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:43.96,0:03:49.56,英文,,0,0,0,,You look at and hear from companies who have massive data center footprints, meta,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:49.56,0:03:56.98,英文,,0,0,0,,talks a lot about RISC-V. Yeah. You hear from you know other hyperscalers
Dialogue: 1,0:03:56.98,0:04:04.06,英文,,0,0,0,,that have incorporated RISC-V into their designs. This is where innovation comes
Dialogue: 1,0:04:04.06,0:04:10.72,英文,,0,0,0,,together with volume and it's RISC-V at scale. So RISC-V is hockey sticking it
Dialogue: 1,0:04:10.72,0:04:15.44,英文,,0,0,0,,seems like and another a whole industry that's been threatening to do that for a
Dialogue: 1,0:04:15.44,0:04:19.66,英文,,0,0,0,,long time and is near and dear to my heart is IOT. So they're obviously very
Dialogue: 1,0:04:19.66,0:04:23.82,英文,,0,0,0,,interested in low power, edge devices, that kind of thing. Are you seeing those
Dialogue: 1,0:04:23.82,0:04:29.56,英文,,0,0,0,,companies in those spaces getting on board with with RISC-V too? So RISC-V is
Dialogue: 1,0:04:29.56,0:04:33.98,英文,,0,0,0,,sort of a catalyst at the right time right place for things like AI and
Dialogue: 1,0:04:33.98,0:04:37.94,英文,,0,0,0,,acceleration and chip and everything. Somebody earlier today was saying
Dialogue: 1,0:04:37.94,0:04:41.18,英文,,0,0,0,,there's gonna be a chip on every cucumber in the supermarket and I was
Dialogue: 1,0:04:41.18,0:04:49.48,英文,,0,0,0,,like whoa. Delicious. Yes, right. Goes well on a salad. So yeah you do have that profound
Dialogue: 1,0:04:49.48,0:04:56.30,英文,,0,0,0,,opportunity but before RISC-V you had a very few people or companies who
Dialogue: 1,0:04:56.30,0:05:00.38,英文,,0,0,0,,could engage in that opportunity because there were too many barriers to entry.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:00.38,0:05:03.90,英文,,0,0,0,,RISC-V that's you know anyone can do with what
Dialogue: 1,0:05:03.90,0:05:07.98,英文,,0,0,0,,they wish so that's why you have more design houses on RISC-V now than any
Dialogue: 1,0:05:07.98,0:05:14.22,英文,,0,0,0,,other architecture in history. So let's get evangelical here. Ladies and
Dialogue: 1,0:05:14.22,0:05:18.60,英文,,0,0,0,,gentlemen, boys and girls, we're gonna get evangelical. Nobody gets that because
Dialogue: 1,0:05:18.60,0:05:24.74,英文,,0,0,0,,we're all in Germany but that's fine. Let's talk about open source because
Dialogue: 1,0:05:24.74,0:05:33.82,英文,,0,0,0,,look RISC-V is embedded in open source and and is clearly a driving force there. I
Dialogue: 1,0:05:33.82,0:05:38.08,英文,,0,0,0,,think that open, personally I think open source is critical to success and
Dialogue: 1,0:05:38.08,0:05:44.14,英文,,0,0,0,,embedded in almost every computing space and there's a place for the walled garden
Dialogue: 1,0:05:44.14,0:05:48.16,英文,,0,0,0,,there's a place for proprietary but I think open source is where a lot of
Dialogue: 1,0:05:48.16,0:05:54.82,英文,,0,0,0,,innovation happens and I know that the RISC-V is really supporting a lot of
Dialogue: 1,0:05:54.82,0:05:59.32,英文,,0,0,0,,that innovation so I want to hear about some of the the open source projects
Dialogue: 1,0:05:59.32,0:06:03.74,英文,,0,0,0,,that you're excited about that you've been seeing happen. So I think open source
Dialogue: 1,0:06:03.74,0:06:08.66,英文,,0,0,0,,is a great idea. I love open source, near and dear to my heart but let's not get too
Dialogue: 1,0:06:08.66,0:06:14.78,英文,,0,0,0,,confused. RISC-V is not open source. RISC-V is a standard and the
Dialogue: 1,0:06:14.78,0:06:19.46,英文,,0,0,0,,difference here is that you take a standard and you freeze it for the test
Dialogue: 1,0:06:19.46,0:06:24.56,英文,,0,0,0,,of time right because if you decide to go off and do your own special Bluetooth
Dialogue: 1,0:06:24.56,0:06:30.26,英文,,0,0,0,,or your own special you know name your favorite hardware interconnect standard
Dialogue: 1,0:06:30.26,0:06:33.66,英文,,0,0,0,,yeah you're all by yourself.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:33.66,0:06:37.86,英文,,0,0,0,,You don't want to be off in those weeds. So a global standard is something
Dialogue: 1,0:06:37.86,0:06:44.28,英文,,0,0,0,,that you collaborate on in our case openly collaborate on and then freeze it
Dialogue: 1,0:06:44.28,0:06:48.64,英文,,0,0,0,,for the test of time and that's a really cool thing yeah and it takes time and it
Dialogue: 1,0:06:48.64,0:06:53.66,英文,,0,0,0,,takes diligence and it takes a lot of like interpersonal like dialogue with
Dialogue: 1,0:06:53.66,0:06:58.46,英文,,0,0,0,,one another in the community that we all come to agree on things right and that's
Dialogue: 1,0:06:58.46,0:07:03.58,英文,,0,0,0,,hard work and we're doing that hard work. We support then open collaborative
Dialogue: 1,0:07:03.58,0:07:07.66,英文,,0,0,0,,collaboration in open source software where you can apply patches. You can
Dialogue: 1,0:07:07.66,0:07:12.44,英文,,0,0,0,,invent something over the weekend and put it up into a repo right yeah and so
Dialogue: 1,0:07:12.44,0:07:18.42,英文,,0,0,0,,yes we absolutely support and honor the open source software community as well.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:18.42,0:07:24.66,英文,,0,0,0,,In fact getting all of those distros to run on RISC-V, getting all the
Dialogue: 1,0:07:24.66,0:07:29.20,英文,,0,0,0,,applications to say you know what I run on these architectures I need to run on
Dialogue: 1,0:07:29.20,0:07:33.50,英文,,0,0,0,,RISC-V too because that's my opportunity. It's not because it's technically
Dialogue: 1,0:07:33.50,0:07:40.30,英文,,0,0,0,,cool it's because there's business value and so what we've seen for you know
Dialogue: 1,0:07:40.30,0:07:46.16,英文,,0,0,0,,Android is an example for the Android team to support RISC-V we needed to
Dialogue: 1,0:07:46.16,0:07:52.12,英文,,0,0,0,,first see volumes and enough customer demand to warrant that investment from
Dialogue: 1,0:07:52.12,0:07:58.34,英文,,0,0,0,,the team. So those are the types of like next era that we're ushering in both in
Dialogue: 1,0:07:58.34,0:08:03.42,英文,,0,0,0,,standards as well as an open source. So as a reporter I wouldn't be doing my
Dialogue: 1,0:08:03.42,0:08:07.38,英文,,0,0,0,,job if I didn't ask the hard questions. So I got I got to put you on the spot
Dialogue: 1,0:08:07.38,0:08:13.44,英文,,0,0,0,,here. Where does RISC-V need to move to that you aren't in yet? That you
Dialogue: 1,0:08:13.44,0:08:17.18,英文,,0,0,0,,aren't that you haven't started exploring yet?
Dialogue: 1,0:08:17.18,0:08:24.88,英文,,0,0,0,,RISC-V has already made like inches forward across the full compute domain. What we
Dialogue: 1,0:08:24.88,0:08:33.34,英文,,0,0,0,,have yet to do is get to scale across all of those domains. So we are on the precipice of
Dialogue: 1,0:08:33.34,0:08:39.72,英文,,0,0,0,,you know going into data center in laptops and all the other devices. There
Dialogue: 1,0:08:39.72,0:08:45.34,英文,,0,0,0,,are lots of predictions about RISC-V in HPC, RISC-V in cell phones and when it
Dialogue: 1,0:08:45.34,0:08:51.16,英文,,0,0,0,,will be the primary processor when it will be all of the processors. A few
Dialogue: 1,0:08:51.16,0:08:57.34,英文,,0,0,0,,years ago I was talking to an analyst who said you know more than 25% of all design
Dialogue: 1,0:08:57.34,0:09:03.26,英文,,0,0,0,,starts include at least one RISC-V core. That was a few years ago. Last summer I talked
Dialogue: 1,0:09:03.26,0:09:08.14,英文,,0,0,0,,to him and I said so what's the number now? And he told me you know it's hard to
Dialogue: 1,0:09:08.14,0:09:13.40,英文,,0,0,0,,find a design start that does not include at least one RISC-V core. So we
Dialogue: 1,0:09:13.40,0:09:19.22,英文,,0,0,0,,are arriving at that design phase and you're going to see us move very
Dialogue: 1,0:09:19.22,0:09:23.60,英文,,0,0,0,,rapidly across that spectrum in the next few years.
Dialogue: 1,0:09:23.60,0:09:29.00,英文,,0,0,0,,So if I don't ask this next question the secret cabal of tech journalists has to
Dialogue: 1,0:09:29.00,0:09:33.18,英文,,0,0,0,,come and take me away. Let's talk about AI.
Dialogue: 1,0:09:33.18,0:09:40.30,英文,,0,0,0,,I know RISC-V is heavily involved in a lot of AI projects and I've talked to
Dialogue: 1,0:09:40.30,0:09:44.92,英文,,0,0,0,,several companies here today that are that are leveraging RISC-V in their AI.
Dialogue: 1,0:09:44.92,0:09:51.66,英文,,0,0,0,,What parts of the RISC-V standard are ideally suited into into working with AI
Dialogue: 1,0:09:51.66,0:09:59.60,英文,,0,0,0,,and why is that so attractive. So AI as well as any other processing has to do
Dialogue: 1,0:09:59.60,0:10:03.10,英文,,0,0,0,,with how much design flexibility you can bring to that work
Dialogue: 1,0:10:03.10,0:10:08.50,英文,,0,0,0,,load and that's where RISC-V and it's you know complete menu of different open
Dialogue: 1,0:10:08.50,0:10:14.02,英文,,0,0,0,,extensions comes into play. But where folks can really find their competitive
Dialogue: 1,0:10:14.02,0:10:18.32,英文,,0,0,0,,edge is in some of the reserved encoding space that you can use for your own
Dialogue: 1,0:10:18.32,0:10:22.62,英文,,0,0,0,,proprietary extensions, your own proprietary or your secret sauce that
Dialogue: 1,0:10:22.62,0:10:27.34,英文,,0,0,0,,makes your AI better than someone else's. But there are things that we're doing as
Dialogue: 1,0:10:27.34,0:10:33.02,英文,,0,0,0,,base building blocks like our vector and vector crypto and other pieces that we've been
Dialogue: 1,0:10:33.02,0:10:41.20,英文,,0,0,0,,ratifying that allow for that new era of design freedom.
Dialogue: 1,0:10:41.20,0:10:45.64,英文,,0,0,0,,So as we get near the end of our time here I like my favorite question to ask is the
Dialogue: 1,0:10:45.64,0:10:51.96,英文,,0,0,0,,one I saved for last and no this is great because it makes you do all the work and the
Dialogue: 1,0:10:51.96,0:10:56.72,英文,,0,0,0,,question is what didn't I think to ask you that's really contributing to the growth of
Dialogue: 1,0:10:56.72,0:11:01.86,英文,,0,0,0,,RISC-V and the strength and everything that everybody should be knowing about but they're
Dialogue: 1,0:11:01.86,0:11:02.94,英文,,0,0,0,,not talking about enough yet.
Dialogue: 1,0:11:02.94,0:11:11.78,英文,,0,0,0,,So I think it's the strength of what you truly get from a collaborative community like this is that you're able to
Dialogue: 1,0:11:11.78,0:11:16.46,英文,,0,0,0,,progress not only our shared mission but you're able to say like wow look
Dialogue: 1,0:11:16.46,0:11:20.06,英文,,0,0,0,,there's you know six other people doing something I thought I had to go do by
Dialogue: 1,0:11:20.06,0:11:23.96,英文,,0,0,0,,myself let's do that together bang it out and then go do the next cool
Dialogue: 1,0:11:23.96,0:11:29.84,英文,,0,0,0,,interesting thing together. You don't have collaboration at scale if you're
Dialogue: 1,0:11:29.84,0:11:32.86,英文,,0,0,0,,working in a proprietary environment. In a proprietary
Dialogue: 1,0:11:32.86,0:11:37.70,英文,,0,0,0,,environment that's called development partner. That's a one to one relationship.
Dialogue: 1,0:11:37.70,0:11:42.62,英文,,0,0,0,,When you have a one to many relationship you actually reduce the level of risk
Dialogue: 1,0:11:42.62,0:11:46.70,英文,,0,0,0,,that's in your business and technical strategy for taking a particular
Dialogue: 1,0:11:46.70,0:11:51.80,英文,,0,0,0,,direction. So that collaboration and that contribution and developer might and
