1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
 One little bit of news that recently dropped. There was an announcement that

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,020
 in China the state organizations are going to be adopting RISC-V or at least

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,340
 exploring it. Tell us a little bit about that. Well I can't speak to other

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,080
 governments but you know we are seeing exponential growth of RISC-V around

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,480
 the world. Last year we saw more than 25% growth year-over-year in our

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,120
 membership. We're more than 4,300 members now which is probably even up a little

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,620
 from our press release because we got last month's close. But we're seeing this

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,080
 diversity of interest in RISC-V that's really profound. We've got about a

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,320
 third of our members in North America, Europe, and APAC. Pretty evenly

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,460
 distributed. And the really cool thing is I've been

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,700
 saying that for five years. It hasn't changed. The level of interest is

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,980
 continuing to skyrocket evenly and profoundly around the world and we're

13
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,500
 adding into that new areas. So the Ministry of Brazil has just signed

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,040
 agreements with the European Union and with you know working out things with

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,840
 Spain and Portugal to do even more for Latin America and Spanish-speaking countries. So

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,540
 the Ministry of Brazil has joined RISC-V and sit on our board now and that's

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,620
 great because when it comes to you know kind of that government support, that

18
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,700
 federal support of RISC-V, it's really important. And whether I'm talking to the

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,980
 European Union on the funds and grants that are going on for RISC-V or

20
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:49,280
 countries like Brazil or India that are investing in RISC-V, the main thing here

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,540
 is invest local. Shore up that local economy. Engage in the digital economy.

22
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,600
 Teach computer science in all your universities and do it on RISC-V.

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,240
 Yeah. Rather than those other architectures. And what you're going to do

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,740
 is engage that in the global economy. Don't do it for yourself. Do it in a

25
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,940
 global way and that's why RISC-V as a standard is so important. Okay I've been

26
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,960
 talking a lot. Your turn. Well look I look forward with this news about Brazil I

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,840
 look forward to the RISC-V Carnival standard. That should be fun. What do you

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,460
 what are some of the industries that are driving all of this growth? I mean I know

29
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,240
 that we've been talking a lot about automotive which is exciting and cool

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,040
 but what are some of your other favorites? So yes, industries driving like

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,100
 automotive. I didn't miss that. You know so embedded this is kind of where it

32
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,200
 started for RISC-V and we've started to really move up the compute spectrum into

33
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,640
 even more robust or performant workloads. So embedded is all about lightweight, low

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,740
 power, portable, very you know single focus design and that has been an

35
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,340
 incredible start and we're starting to see that grow into mobile. We've seen a

36
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,060
 lot with Android coming onto the systems for or onto RISC-V for application

37
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,640
 processing but that's not the only processor in your phone. You also have

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,380
 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, all the other pieces and parts of your phone that you know

39
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,360
 there's a lot of area there that everyone can take advantage of. You move

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,440
 from there into you know tablets, laptops, we've got a couple of those here at the

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,940
 show. You move from there into data center and the workloads that are

42
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,960
 looking to come on to RISC-V and the data center is already pretty profound.

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,560
 You look at and hear from companies who have massive data center footprints, meta,

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,980
 talks a lot about RISC-V. Yeah. You hear from you know other hyperscalers

45
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:04,060
 that have incorporated RISC-V into their designs. This is where innovation comes

46
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,720
 together with volume and it's RISC-V at scale. So RISC-V is hockey sticking it

47
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,440
 seems like and another a whole industry that's been threatening to do that for a

48
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,660
 long time and is near and dear to my heart is IOT. So they're obviously very

49
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,820
 interested in low power, edge devices, that kind of thing. Are you seeing those

50
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,560
 companies in those spaces getting on board with with RISC-V too? So RISC-V is

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,980
 sort of a catalyst at the right time right place for things like AI and

52
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,940
 acceleration and chip and everything. Somebody earlier today was saying

53
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,180
 there's gonna be a chip on every cucumber in the supermarket and I was

54
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:49,480
 like whoa. Delicious. Yes, right. Goes well on a salad. So yeah you do have that profound

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,300
 opportunity but before RISC-V you had a very few people or companies who

56
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,380
 could engage in that opportunity because there were too many barriers to entry.

57
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,900
 RISC-V that's you know anyone can do with what

58
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,980
 they wish so that's why you have more design houses on RISC-V now than any

59
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:14,220
 other architecture in history. So let's get evangelical here. Ladies and

60
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,600
 gentlemen, boys and girls, we're gonna get evangelical. Nobody gets that because

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,740
 we're all in Germany but that's fine. Let's talk about open source because

62
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:33,820
 look RISC-V is embedded in open source and and is clearly a driving force there. I

63
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,080
 think that open, personally I think open source is critical to success and

64
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,140
 embedded in almost every computing space and there's a place for the walled garden

65
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,160
 there's a place for proprietary but I think open source is where a lot of

66
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,820
 innovation happens and I know that the RISC-V is really supporting a lot of

67
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,320
 that innovation so I want to hear about some of the the open source projects

68
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,740
 that you're excited about that you've been seeing happen. So I think open source

69
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,660
 is a great idea. I love open source, near and dear to my heart but let's not get too

70
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,780
 confused. RISC-V is not open source. RISC-V is a standard and the

71
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,460
 difference here is that you take a standard and you freeze it for the test

72
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,560
 of time right because if you decide to go off and do your own special Bluetooth

73
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,260
 or your own special you know name your favorite hardware interconnect standard

74
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,660
 yeah you're all by yourself.

75
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,860
 You don't want to be off in those weeds. So a global standard is something

76
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,280
 that you collaborate on in our case openly collaborate on and then freeze it

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,640
 for the test of time and that's a really cool thing yeah and it takes time and it

78
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,660
 takes diligence and it takes a lot of like interpersonal like dialogue with

79
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,460
 one another in the community that we all come to agree on things right and that's

80
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,580
 hard work and we're doing that hard work. We support then open collaborative

81
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,660
 collaboration in open source software where you can apply patches. You can

82
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,440
 invent something over the weekend and put it up into a repo right yeah and so

83
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,420
 yes we absolutely support and honor the open source software community as well.

84
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:24,660
 In fact getting all of those distros to run on RISC-V, getting all the

85
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,200
 applications to say you know what I run on these architectures I need to run on

86
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,500
 RISC-V too because that's my opportunity. It's not because it's technically

87
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,300
 cool it's because there's business value and so what we've seen for you know

88
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,160
 Android is an example for the Android team to support RISC-V we needed to

89
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,120
 first see volumes and enough customer demand to warrant that investment from

90
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,340
 the team. So those are the types of like next era that we're ushering in both in

91
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,420
 standards as well as an open source. So as a reporter I wouldn't be doing my

92
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,380
 job if I didn't ask the hard questions. So I got I got to put you on the spot

93
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,440
 here. Where does RISC-V need to move to that you aren't in yet? That you

94
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,180
 aren't that you haven't started exploring yet?

95
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:24,880
 RISC-V has already made like inches forward across the full compute domain. What we

96
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:33,340
 have yet to do is get to scale across all of those domains. So we are on the precipice of

97
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:39,720
 you know going into data center in laptops and all the other devices. There

98
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,340
 are lots of predictions about RISC-V in HPC, RISC-V in cell phones and when it

99
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,160
 will be the primary processor when it will be all of the processors. A few

100
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,340
 years ago I was talking to an analyst who said you know more than 25% of all design

101
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:03,260
 starts include at least one RISC-V core. That was a few years ago. Last summer I talked

102
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,140
 to him and I said so what's the number now? And he told me you know it's hard to

103
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,400
 find a design start that does not include at least one RISC-V core. So we

104
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,220
 are arriving at that design phase and you're going to see us move very

105
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,600
 rapidly across that spectrum in the next few years.

106
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,000
 So if I don't ask this next question the secret cabal of tech journalists has to

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,180
 come and take me away. Let's talk about AI.

108
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,300
 I know RISC-V is heavily involved in a lot of AI projects and I've talked to

109
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,920
 several companies here today that are that are leveraging RISC-V in their AI.

110
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,660
 What parts of the RISC-V standard are ideally suited into into working with AI

111
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:59,600
 and why is that so attractive. So AI as well as any other processing has to do

112
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,100
 with how much design flexibility you can bring to that work

113
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,500
 load and that's where RISC-V and it's you know complete menu of different open

114
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,020
 extensions comes into play. But where folks can really find their competitive

115
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,320
 edge is in some of the reserved encoding space that you can use for your own

116
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,620
 proprietary extensions, your own proprietary or your secret sauce that

117
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,340
 makes your AI better than someone else's. But there are things that we're doing as

118
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,020
 base building blocks like our vector and vector crypto and other pieces that we've been

119
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:41,200
 ratifying that allow for that new era of design freedom.

120
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,640
 So as we get near the end of our time here I like my favorite question to ask is the

121
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,960
 one I saved for last and no this is great because it makes you do all the work and the

122
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,720
 question is what didn't I think to ask you that's really contributing to the growth of

123
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,860
 RISC-V and the strength and everything that everybody should be knowing about but they're

124
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,940
 not talking about enough yet.

125
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:11,780
 So I think it's the strength of what you truly get from a collaborative community like this is that you're able to

126
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,460
 progress not only our shared mission but you're able to say like wow look

127
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,060
 there's you know six other people doing something I thought I had to go do by

128
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,960
 myself let's do that together bang it out and then go do the next cool

129
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,840
 interesting thing together. You don't have collaboration at scale if you're

130
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,860
 working in a proprietary environment. In a proprietary

131
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,700
 environment that's called development partner. That's a one to one relationship.

132
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,620
 When you have a one to many relationship you actually reduce the level of risk

133
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,700
 that's in your business and technical strategy for taking a particular

134
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,800
 direction. So that collaboration and that contribution and developer might and

135
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,960
 strength is something I think is often assumed and overlooked in a community

136
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,780
 like ours. It accelerates your individual traction as well as brings learning back into

137
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,620
 your organization that you wouldn't get any other way.

138
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,540
 Well folks I think the message here is pretty clear. It's time to take a risk.

139
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
 Five.

140
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
 Thank you.
