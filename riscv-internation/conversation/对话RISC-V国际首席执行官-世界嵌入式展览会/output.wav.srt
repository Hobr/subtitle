1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
 One little bit of news that recently dropped. There was an announcement that

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,020
 in China the state organizations are going to be adopting RISC-V or at least

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,340
 exploring it. Tell us a little bit about that. Well I can't speak to other

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,080
 governments but you know we are seeing exponential growth of RISC-V around

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,480
 the world. Last year we saw more than 25% growth year-over-year in our

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,120
 membership. We're more than 4,300 members now which is probably even up a little

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,620
 from our press release because we got last month's close. But we're seeing this

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,080
 diversity of interest in RISC-V that's really profound. We've got about a

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,320
 third of our members in North America, Europe, and APAC. Pretty evenly

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,460
 distributed. And the really cool thing is I've been

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,700
 saying that for five years. It hasn't changed. The level of interest is

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,980
 continuing to skyrocket evenly and profoundly around the world and we're

13
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,500
 adding into that new areas. So the Ministry of Brazil has just signed

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,040
 agreements with the European Union and with you know working out things with

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,840
 Spain and Portugal to do even more for Latin America and Spanish-speaking countries. So

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,540
 the Ministry of Brazil has joined RISC-V and sit on our board now and that's

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,620
 great because when it comes to you know kind of that government support, that

18
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,700
 federal support of RISC-V, it's really important. And whether I'm talking to the

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,980
 European Union on the funds and grants that are going on for RISC-V or

20
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:49,280
 countries like Brazil or India that are investing in RISC-V, the main thing here

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,520
 is invest local. Shore up that local economy. Engage in the digital economy.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,280
 Teach computer science in all your universities and do it on RISC-V.

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,900
 Rather than those other architectures. And what you're going to do is engage

24
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,600
 that in the global economy. Don't do it for yourself. Do it in a global way. And

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,520
 that's why RISC-V as a standard is so important. Okay I've been talking a lot.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,540
 Your turn. Well look I look forward with this news about Brazil, I look forward to

27
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,020
 the RISC-V Carnival standard. That should be fun. What are some of

28
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,640
 the industries that are driving all of this growth? I mean I know that we've

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
 been talking a lot about automotive, which is exciting and cool, but what are

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,840
 some of your other favorites? So yes, industries driving like automotives. I

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,900
 didn't miss that. You know so embedded. This is kind of where it started for RISC-V.

32
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:51,040
 And we've started to really move up the compute spectrum into even more

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,640
 robust or performant workloads. So embedded is all about lightweight, low

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,780
 power, portable, very single focus design. And that has been an incredible start.

35
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,220
 And we're starting to see that grow into mobile. We've seen a lot with Android

36
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,280
 coming onto the systems for or onto RISC-V for application processing. But

37
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,040
 that's not the only processor in your phone. You also have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,540
 all the other pieces and parts of your phone that you know there's a lot of

39
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,760
 area there that everyone can take advantage of. You move from there into

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,500
 you know tablets, laptops, we've got a couple of those here at the show. You

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,160
 move from there into data center and the workloads that are looking to come on to

42
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,920
 RISC-V and the data center is already pretty profound. You look at and hear from

43
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,880
 companies who have massive data center footprints. Meta talks a lot about RISC-V.

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,620
 You hear from you know other hyperscalers that have

45
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,040
 incorporated RISC-V into their designs. This is where innovation comes

46
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,540
 together with volume and it's RISC-V at scale. So RISC-V is hockey sticking it seems.

47
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,040
 It seems like and another a whole industry that's been threatening to do

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,880
 that for a long time and is near and dear to my heart is IOT. So they're

49
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,480
 obviously very interested in low power, edge devices, that kind of thing. Are you

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,500
 seeing those companies in those spaces getting on board with with RISC-V too?

51
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,780
 So RISC-V is sort of a catalyst at the right time right place for things like AI

52
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,700
 and acceleration and chip and everything. Somebody earlier today was

53
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,920
 saying there's gonna be a chip on every cucumber

54
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:48,680
 in the supermarket. Delicious. Yes, right. Goes well in a salad. So yeah you do have

55
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,460
 that profound opportunity but before RISC-V you had a very few people or

56
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,300
 companies who could engage in that opportunity because there were too many

57
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,540
 barriers to entry. RISC-V that's you know anyone can do with what they wish so

58
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,180
 that's why you have more design houses on RISC-V now than any other

59
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,080
 architecture in history.

60
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,840
 So let's get evangelical here. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we're gonna get

61
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,140
 evangelical. Nobody gets that because we're all in Germany but that's fine.

62
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:28,460
 Let's talk about open source because look RISC-V is embedded in open source

63
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,360
 and and is clearly a driving force there. I think that open, personally I think

64
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,460
 open source is critical to success and embedded in almost every computing space

65
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,500
 and there's a place for the walled garden, there's a place for proprietary

66
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,200
 but I think open source is where a lot of innovation happens and I know that

67
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,660
 the RISC-V is really supporting a lot of that innovation so I want to hear about

68
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,500
 some of the the open source projects that you're excited about that you've

69
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,120
 been seeing happen.

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,740
 So I love open source.

71
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,160
 Near and dear to my heart but let's not get too confused. RISC-V is not open

72
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,640
 source. RISC-V is a standard and the difference here is that you take a

73
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,640
 standard and you freeze it for the test of time, right? Because if you decide to go

74
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,780
 off and do your own special Bluetooth or your own special you know name your

75
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,120
 favorite hardware interconnect standard, you're all by yourself. You don't

76
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,440
 want to be off in those weeds. So a global standard is something that you

77
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,500
 collaborate on, in our case openly collaborate on, and then freeze it for

78
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,640
 the test of time and that's a really cool thing. And it takes time and it

79
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,680
 takes diligence and it takes a lot of like interpersonal like dialogue with

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,480
 one another in the community that we all come to agree on things, right? And that's

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,300
 hard work and we're doing that hard work. We support then open collaboration in

82
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,560
 open source software where you can apply patches. You can invent something over

83
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,660
 the weekend and put it up into a repo, right? And so yes we absolutely

84
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:19,480
 support and honor the open source software community as well. In fact

85
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,620
 getting all of those distros to run on RISC-V, getting all the applications to

86
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,960
 say you know what I run on these architectures, I need to run on RISC-V too

87
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,860
 because that's my opportunity. It's not because it's technically cool, it's

88
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,460
 because there's business value. And so what we've seen for you know Android is

89
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,880
 an example. For the Android team to support RISC-V, we needed to first see

90
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,280
 volumes and enough customer demand to warrant that investment from the team. So

91
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,040
 those are the types of like next era that we're ushering in both in standards

92
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,900
 as well as an open source. So as a reporter I wouldn't be doing my job if I

93
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,620
 didn't ask the hard questions. So I got I got to put you on the spot here.

94
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:14,600
 Where does RISC-V need to move to that you aren't in yet? That you

95
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:21,660
 haven't started exploring yet? RISC-V has already made like inches forward

96
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:29,280
 across the full compute domain. What we have yet to do is get to scale across all

97
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,760
 of those domains. So we are on the precipice of you know going into data

98
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,940
 center in laptops and all the other devices. There are lots of predictions

99
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,280
 about RISC-V in HPC, RISC-V in cell phones and when it will be the primary

100
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,640
 processor, when it will be all of the processors. A few years ago, I was at a

101
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,820
 meeting with an analyst who said you know more than 25% of all design starts

102
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,880
 include at least one RISC-V core. That was a few years ago. Last summer I

103
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,660
 talked to him and I said so what's the number now? And he told me you know it's

104
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,400
 hard to find a design start that does not include at least one RISC-V core.

105
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,940
 So we are arriving at that design phase and you're going to see us move

106
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,640
 very rapidly across that spectrum in the next few years.

107
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,000
 So if I don't ask this next question, the secret cabal of tech

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,420
 journalists has to come and take me away. Let's talk about AI. I know

109
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,300
 RISC-V is heavily involved in a lot of AI projects and I've talked to

110
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,720
 several companies here today that are that are leveraging RISC-V in their

111
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,520
 AI. What parts of the RISC-V standard are ideally suited into into working with AI?

112
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,520
 And why is that so attractive?

113
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,780
 So AI as well as any other processing has to do with how much design

114
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,020
 flexibility you can bring to that workload and that's where RISC-V and

115
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,800
 it's you know complete menu of different open extensions comes into play. But

116
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,340
 where folks can really find their competitive edge is in some of the

117
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,960
 reserved encoding space that you can use for your own proprietary extensions, your

118
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,840
 own proprietary or your own proprietary RISC-V.

119
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,940
 So it's your secret sauce that makes your AI better than someone else's. But there

120
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,800
 are things that we're doing as base building blocks like our vector and

121
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,780
 vector crypto and other pieces that we've been ratifying that allow for that

122
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,400
 new era of design freedom.

123
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,360
 So as we get near the the end of our time here, I like my

124
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,440
 favorite question to ask is the one I saved for last. And no this is great

125
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,340
 because it makes you do all the work.

126
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,720
 And the question is what didn't I think to ask you that's really contributing to

127
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,620
 the growth of RISC-V and and and the strength and everything that everybody

128
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,900
 should be knowing about but they're not talking about enough yet?

129
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,520
 So I think it's the

130
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,460
 strength of what you truly get from a collaborative community like this is

131
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:15,240
 that you're able to progress not only our shared mission but you're able to

132
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,260
 say like wow look there's you know six other people doing something I thought I

133
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,320
 had to go do by myself.

134
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,520
 Let's do that together bang it out and then go do the next cool interesting

135
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,220
 thing together. You don't have collaboration at scale with your working

136
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,600
 in a proprietary environment. In a proprietary environment that's called

137
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,220
 development partner. That's a one-to-one relationship. When you have a one-to-many

138
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,780
 relationship you actually reduce the level of risk that's in your business

139
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,040
 and technical strategy for taking a particular direction. So that

140
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,200
 collaboration and that contribution is really important.

141
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,360
 I think that's something I think is often assumed and overlooked in a

142
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,660
 community like ours. It accelerates your individual traction as well as brings

143
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:08,480
 learning back into your organization that you wouldn't get any other way.

144
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,400
 Well folks I think the message here is pretty clear. It's time to take a RISC-V.

145
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,760
 I think it's time for you to take a RISC-V and start the RISC-V.

146
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,380
 You're not going to take a RISC-V you're going to take a RISC-V and you're going

147
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,460
 to take a RISC-V and you're going to take a RISC-V you're going to take a RISC-V
